                "content": "German business accountsThey decided to start their own small company. Perhaps you have been successful as an entrepreneur for some time and are looking for a way to keep a constant eye on your income and expenses. The reasons for looking for a business account may vary. Usually, however, you will encounter this question at the latest when you start a business. Although there are only a few legal regulations, a separate account for your business serves above all to simplify payment transactions with your customers and suppliers. In addition, a separate company account gives you a better overview of your business income and expenses as well as the taxes to be paid.But what do you need to keep in mind when opening a business account? Which company account is the right one and what are the costs? We will answer these and many other questions here.What is a business account?The business account is often already recommended with the establishment of a company. This is a separate current account that entrepreneurs can use to book business deposits and withdrawals on behalf of the company. This prevents private and business incoming and outgoing payments from being mixed in the same account.Almost every bank provides separate accounts for freelancers and entrepreneurs. The conditions for self-employed persons often differ significantly from the conditions for private current accounts. The bank thus takes account of the fact that freelancers and entrepreneurs have different requirements for their accounts.In addition to the current account for business use, there are also overnight or fixed-term deposits for companies. They can also be differentiated according to the usual accounts for private customers and business customers.How do classic current accounts differ from business accounts?The functions of a business account differ only slightly from those of a private account. You transfer money from your business account, order direct debits and set up standing orders. You can withdraw money from an ATM with your EC or Giro card. Cashless payment is also possible. If you have cheque deposits posted to your account or make cash deposits, these work in exactly the same way as with a private checking account.If you have a credit card issued for your account, you can use it to withdraw money from ATMs outside the euro area. You use your credit card for cashless payments primarily in countries with foreign currencies. Business expenses or purchases on the Internet in the name and invoice of your company are also paid for with the company credit card.There is often a big difference between classic current accounts and business accounts when it comes to advice from the bank. Corporate customers are a lucrative clientele who are courted by many banks. However, they are also a consulting-intensive target group with special needs. Many banks have recognized this and offer a special corporate customer service. As the account holder, you then have your own personal advisor. He is very well informed about your company, knows the current business figures and has insight into the development of sales and profits. This is particularly important when it comes to granting loans. Therefore, you should seek regular exchanges with your bank advisor to take advantage of his service if it is necessary for your business situation.A business account - many advantagesFor entrepreneurs, a separate corporate account offers several advantages. First and foremost, a business account simplifies the separate processing of private and business payment transactions. This is important for you as an entrepreneur so that you have an overview of your companyâs income and expenses at all times. If the transactions mix with your private payments, this overview is not given. If you carry out many transactions for your business, these can simply no longer be overlooked on the private account.Already as a founder you can minimize your administrative expenses from the beginning with a business account. Especially with an increasing number of business bookings it is easier to start with a separation as early as possible in order to be prepared for the expansion of the business. In addition, early separation will help you avoid the difficulties of later separation. If you change your account afterwards, you will have to reckon with returns and incorrect postings that have to be corrected afterwards.In addition, a bank may require you to open a corporate account if you have a free private account and a variety of transactions for your business. Other advantages of the corporate account are the additional services that some banks offer their customers. These include, for example, additional credit cards or the management of a foreign currency account. There are only legal requirements for companies with share capital such as the limited partnership (KG), the entrepreneurial company haftungsbeschrÃ¤nkt (UG) and the limited liability company (GmbH).Also advantageous is the separation of both accounts for the insight of the tax office. The tax authority will usually require insight into your business transactions, while private expenses will not be audited by it. This is easier if you have a business and a private current account.In what cases is a business account mandatory?As a freelancer or self-employed person, you are not obliged to maintain a business current account. In these cases it may also be sufficient to open another private account and manage it as a company account. Make sure, however, that the account suits your needs. If, for example, you open a free account with a minimum turnover, you will have to expect additional fees if this minimum turnover is not reached. If, on the other hand, the number of bookings increases sharply, the bank will probably suggest using a business account, which can be more expensive.You are only obliged to maintain a business account if you set up a corporation. These include in particular the limited liability company (GmbH), the limited liability company (UG) and the stock corporation (AG). With these companies, the founding capital must be paid into the companyâs account. A joint-stock company is generally out of the question for founders. The GmbH and the UG are, however, very popular forms for founding a company. If you decide to do so, you must open a business account.For whom is a business account useful?In general, however, company accounts make sense for anyone who runs their own business because of the advantages already listed. Business accounts are not only opened by companies, but also by freelancers and self-employed with a trade.When can which business account be considered?Not every company account is suitable for every self-employed person. The services provided by banks vary, so it is worth comparing prices and services before opening an account. If, for example, you only do a small business, a free account with a direct bank is an interesting alternative. The netbank, N26 or the Fidor Bank are suitable for this. The Fidor Bank is also recommended as a business account for the holders of a partnership under civil law. Who leads an Onlineshop, has different offers to the selection. If the Onlineshop already reached a certain size, so that many reservations are to be completed, is worth itself a offerer with appropriate quantity discounts. Payment possibilities as the direct debit or a SofortÃ¼berweisung should be absolutely possible. For a GmbH it is important to limit the necessary achievements before the account opening. Fidor Bank also offers attractive offers for this type of company.Find the right company account: What you need to keep in mindUnfortunately there is no blanket recommendation for the right business account. It always depends on your individual needs which account is best suited. So before you open an account, think about what services are important to you. The usual services are usually part of the standard package: Carrying out transfers for deposits and withdrawals Provision of account statements Issue of an EC or giro card for withdrawing cash from an ATMFurther services such as the establishment of a overdraft facility and the issue of a credit card can be added. These two services in particular are cost-intensive and not absolutely necessary for self-employed or freelancers. So consider whether you want to take advantage of them. If you do not do so, you will save money, especially on the interest on the overdraft facility. Your account will then only be managed on a credit basis and no credit line will be granted.As soon as you know what requirements you have for your company account, compare the providers. In this way, you will find the perfect account for your company relatively quickly and securely.Open a German business account: You will need these documentsIt depends a little bit on the form of the company which documents you have to present for opening an account. As a rule, credit reports are required. In addition, the contract for the account must be completed and signed. If you only need a business account for simple deposits and withdrawals, you can apply for it online at many banks with just a few clicks and easily verify it using the VideoIdent procedure. All you then have to do is enter your tax number.Some banks may require you as a trader to submit a copy of your business registration. The bank may ask you to provide older account statements in order to obtain an overview of the scope of your previous business activities.Other documents include your identity card and an extract from the commercial register if your company is registered. If it is a company with a partnership agreement, this must also be presented when the account is opened. If you wish to have an overdraft facility granted for your account, further documents are required. The bank then requires a current income tax assessment, a current assessment for your input tax and a bank statement showing the last advance payment for input tax.What does a German buiness account cost?Unfortunately, there are relatively few business accounts that are provided free of charge. Free business accounts are current accounts for which there is neither a basic price nor expenses for bookings. EC cards or credit cards should also be free of charge. However, such accounts may be subject to conditions such as a fixed minimum turnover. If you do not achieve this turnover, you will have to pay an account maintenance fee. Anyone who carries out payment transactions with foreign countries must pay fees for cross-border payments. Only some direct banks charge no fees for these transactions.As a self-employed person, freelancer or small entrepreneur, you may find a bank that offers a free corporate account without conditions. You can often use a second private account for this purpose. Entrepreneurs and medium-sized businesses, on the other hand, have to open a company account with all relevant services and pay a basic fee per month. Also the reservations are frequently not free of charge, for cheque deposits or for voucher bookings a fee is due likewise. An enormous cost factor lies in the interest on the overdraft facility. They make up a considerable amount, so you should compare them carefully before opening your account.Is it possible to open a German business account despite a creditorâs entry?If you have a negative entry in the Schufa, it will be difficult to open an account with a bank. In particular, it is virtually impossible to set up a overdraft facility in this case. This is due to the fact that the bank assumes with such customers that they cannot repay the credit. An alternative may be to open a business account on a credit basis. No credit is then granted for the company account. Money can only be spent if there is a credit balance on the account. The Fidor Bank is a good contact in such cases. Some direct banks also provide an account if there is a credit entry. The business account of N26 is specially designed for freelancers and self-employed. Other alternatives are Holvi or Penta, which also offer an account for corporations.In principle one must know that a Schufaeintrag will lead again and again to problems, if one leads a business relation with a bank. It is therefore highly recommended that you first concentrate on fixing the cause of this entry and wait until it is deleted from the creditorâs register before concentrating on a new professional challenge. Every Schufa entry has a reason and starting a business is an enormous burden for the entrepreneur. Therefore, it is better to first settle the financial situation and get the Schufa in order before concentrating on building a business with all the financial uncertainties."

                "content": "Behind Fyrst is DB Privat- und Firmenkundenbank AG with Deutsche Bank and Postbank.

Transactions can be released conveniently and securely using a password, a fingerprint or facial recognition.A disadvantage could be the restriction of free transactions to only 50 transactions per month. Thus, the business account in the Base variant is not suitable for self-employed persons whose business activity already accounts for a larger volume.Open Fyrst Base business accountThe business account is opened online in just a few steps. Once the data has been entered, it is necessary to prove your identity using a video ID or conventional PostIdent. The account is then activated.Conclusion to the Fyrst Base business accountWith the Fyrst Base business account you want to target self-employed people whose business operations are still manageable. For this customer group, the account offers all important services such as the processing of cashless payment transactions either free of charge or at very reasonable prices.

The company acts as FinTech and provides an account, but it does not act as the account-holding bank. This task lies with Solaris Bank, which also has its headquarters in Berlin. Kontistâs approach is interesting in principle, because with a free account the account holder receives a largely free account in which services are reduced to the essential aspects for freelancers and tradespeople.Services of the Kontist Free Business AccountAn app is offered for account management. The account holder is informed about all account movements via push messages and is kept up to date on his account balance in real time. Sub-accounts or a second current account cannot be set up per customer. In addition to the already included virtual credit card, a plastic credit card for the business account is optionally available. It is managed on a credit basis. The bank does not grant a credit line for the Mastercard nor an overdraft credit for the account. Cash deposits are not offered, a credit can only be deposited by means of bank transfers to the account.For whom is the Kontist Free business account suitable?The Kontist Free Business Account is especially suitable for professionals and freelancers who are still at the beginning of their professional development and who do not yet have any employees. Legal entities such as the Unternehmergesellschaft haftungsbeschrÃ¤nkt or the GmbH are not allowed to use Kontist Free at the moment.Prices &amp; Conditions of the Kontist Free Business AccountAccount management with Kontist Free is free of charge. There are also no fees for booking items. Costs are incurred if a return debit note is booked or if research orders have to be placed. These services are not part of the usual banking routine and are therefore subject to charges.The plastic credit card is charged at an annual rate of 29 euros, the virtual credit card is already included. If the turnover on the plastic card exceeds 3,000 euros, the annual fee is waived. Payments in a foreign currency cost 1.7 percent of the turnover. Two euros are payable for each cash withdrawal with the credit card. The card turnover of 120,000 euros per year may not be exceeded. This framework should be sufficient for self-employed persons who do not yet run a company that is too large.Special features of the Kontist Free business accountKontist Free is a creation-free account. The account holder does not have to provide any Schufa information. This is rather rare for business accounts, but can be advantageous for self-employed persons who cannot open a business account with an overdraft limit due to a Schufa entry.Another special feature are the additional services, because Kontist offers a quite extensive accounting function for the account, which a self-employed person would otherwise have to buy from another provider. Both for the bookkeeping and for the calculation production partner programs are available, with which the business account can be linked. Kontist then classifies each entry in the accounting, the process runs with the help of the learning program more and more accurately. This saves the self-employed an enormous amount of time, which they no longer have to spend on their bookkeeping. Anyone who has hitherto employed a tax consultant can significantly reduce these costs.Advantages and disadvantages of the Kontist Free business accountThe Kontist Free is reduced to the essential services such as the actual account management and the processing of cashless payment transactions. This means that essential functions are covered free of charge. The account is also suitable for self-employed persons who are not allowed to open an account with a credit line due to a Schufa entry. However, the disadvantage is that no overdraft facility is granted.Open Kontist Free Business AccountThe account is opened digitally, the PostIdent procedure is replaced by a voice function and video identification. For the opening, the most important personal data must be kept ready, and the tax identification number must also be provided. If desired, the PostIdent procedure can also be used for identification."

Based on this, the tax calculation program calculates how many reserves are to be formed for tax or other expenses. At the same time, it calculates how much financial leeway the account holder can make use of.These clever services are taken over by a tax consultant for many self-employed people. With Kontist Premium, you can at least partially save the advice of a tax expert and thus also significantly reduce costs and time for administrative tasks.Advantages and disadvantages of the Kontist Premium business accountOne of the major advantages is the transparent cost structure. Also the quick opening without personal legitimation by PostIdent is to be welcomed. The fact that the account is not subject to a disposition framework can have a negative effect. If expenses are incurred, the account must have a credit balance and, if necessary, be topped up beforehand.Open Kontist Premium Business AccountThe business account can be opened completely online on request. If desired, the PostIdent procedure can be replaced by a video legitimation. This means that the opening is completed within a short time and the account is available with all its functions. Also comprehensive documents are not to be submitted, so that the administrative expenditure keeps itself within limits.Conclusion on the Kontist Premium business accountKontistâs premium account is particularly interesting due to its comprehensive additional services such as the link to accounting and tax calculation. As a self-employed person, you receive all the essential services that require a lot of time and a certain amount of specialist knowledge or that have to be assigned to a tax expert. In return, the self-employed person pays a transparently calculated fee so that he knows each month how high his basic fee is. Only the costs for payments by credit card are added to the Kontist Premium business account."

Cash withdrawals are also possible worldwide in any currency. A black Mastercard is linked to the You account. It guarantees a comprehensive service package for various insurance companies that are interesting when travelling.The Allianz insurer covers treatment costs when travelling abroad in the case of acute illnesses as well as injuries after accidents when travelling.

Otherwise, it may happen that a service you expect is not provided and that you have to pay the costs of an insured event out of your own pocket.Advantages and disadvantages of the N26 Business You Business AccountThe biggest advantage of the account is certainly the integrated insurance cover abroad. As a rule, such benefits are only included in the price of premium class accounts. If you are frequently abroad, it is worth checking the insurance conditions more closely and making use of this service. Disadvantageous are the general restrictions that N26 provides for business customers. For example, it is not possible to open another account for private use only.All advantages of the N26 Business Business Account at a glance Free payment in any currency Transactions in real time as push message to mobile phone Export of all transactions as CSV file Automatic categorization of all issues Transactions in real time as push message to mobile phone Web app and mobile phone app available Online invoice tools can be integrated Travel insurance included (treatment costs on trips abroad in case of acute illnesses as well as injuries after accidents on trips) Reimbursement for flight or baggage delays of more than 4 hours Insurance cover for theft of smartphones and cash Mastercard insurance coverage worldwideOpen a business account with N26The account opening is done within a few minutes on the website.

                "content": "N26 is one of the young providers of banking services. The company was not founded until 2013. The aim was to offer mobile banking at a reasonable price. The aim was to address either private or business customers. The preferred target group today is the self-employed who want a free checking account with the most important basic services.Services of the N26 Business Business AccountThe Business Business Account of N26 covers the most important services for freelancers. Withdrawing cash from ATMs in euros is free of charge, as is paying in any currency. There is an attractive cashback system for purchases, provided they have been paid for via the account. Private and business payment transactions can be processed jointly via the account. To use the free Business Mastercard, all transactions are sent in real time as a push message to the mobile phone. In this way, card payments, transfers and direct debits are displayed and automatically divided into categories.For whom is the N26 Business Business Account suitable?The N26 Business Account is suitable for self-employed and freelancers who want to use their account primarily for business purposes. If you want to open an account with N26, you are not yet allowed to be a customer of the provider. This means that the parallel use of a private and a business account is not possible. In addition, the main residence is limited to one of the countries where N26 is currently on the market. These include, among others, Germany and Austria.Prices &amp; Conditions of the N26 Business Business AccountN26âs business account is free. Account maintenance fees are not charged. Transfers to foreign accounts are made via TransferWise and are therefore much cheaper than with traditional commercial banks.Features of the N26 Business Business AccountA cashback of 0.1 percent is granted on all purchases made with the Business Mastercard. Since it is not possible to have a private and a business account with N26, there is a good alternative. Both private and business expenses are paid through the same account. With Mastercard, all business expenses are paid. If you also want a card for private payments, order the Maestro card in the app. The private costs are then paid via the Maestro card. In this way you benefit from the business and private advantages of the N26 business account. The only important thing is that you mainly use the current account for your business.Advantages and disadvantages of the N26 Business Business AccountThe big advantage of the N26 business account is certainly the slim power spectrum in combination with the low price. If you can reduce the benefits of your business account to a minimum, you will be rewarded with a very attractive price. The sending of push messages in real time and the categorisation of expenses are also interesting features. They help you keep your costs under control and control expenses more easily.The disadvantage is that it is currently not possible to be a private or business customer at N26. Paying for private expenses with the optional Maestro card is one way to pay for private and business expenses through an account. However, this should only work if you have little to pay privately.All advantages of the N26 Business Business Account at a glance No account maintenance fee Free payment in any currency Free Business Mastercard 0.1% cashback on all purchases with Business Mastercard Transactions in real time as push message to mobile phone Automatic categorization of all issues Web app and mobile phone app available Export of all transactions as CSV file For private and business useOpen a business account with the N26The opening of the account is done online, with only a few details. To register, you need to enter your first and last name. This ensures that a freelancer only registers if he/she performs his/her duties in his/her own name. The company name is therefore not visible on the account or on the card. To open an account, all you need is a PC or smartphone and no paper is required.Conclusion on the N26 Business business accountThis business account is ideal for freelancers who focus on the basic services of a current account and want to pay little for them. It is recommended that all private payment transactions be made through a separate account with another bank and not mixed."

                "content": "Services of the netbank business accountThe netbank business account offers a low-cost account management including online banking. Cash can be withdrawn at around 2.5 million ATMs with the MasterCard logo when MasterCard is added. Digital account statements or the SMS service provide information on the account balance. The account thus covers all the important functions of a company account. Extra services such as sub-accounts, SMS service and MasterCard can be booked individually for a low fee.For whom is the netbank business account suitable?The netbank wants to address freelancers, sole traders and sole traders with its account. The target group are self-employed people who run their business as a partnership and therefore need a manageable business operation. By the possibility of opening further subaccounts, customers can keep still better the overview of expenditures and incomes. The corporate account can be opened by business customers from any industry - either in the name of the customer or in the name of the (legally responsible) company.Prices &amp; conditions of the netbank business accountSince 1 October 2019, netbank has been offering its business customers a new account model: Until now, it was possible to choose between the basic and the premium business account. From October 2019, netbank will offer only one business account, which combines the conditions of the previous models. With an account management fee of â¬ 4.85 per month (â¬ 58.20 per year) and 10 free booking items included, this is a low-cost company account. Each additional voucherless booking costs customers â¬ 0.15, card transactions with the MasterCard do not count as booking items.The MasterCard Debit Business can be optionally booked in addition and is available for an annual fee of 10 euros. The same conditions apply to partner and additional cards. The credit card can be used to withdraw cash at over 2.5 million ATMs worldwide. One ATM use per month is free of charge, each further withdrawal costs â¬3.Optionally, sub-accounts can also be added by the account holder, whereby the costs for each sub-account amount to â¬ 2.50 per month. So that customers always keep the overview of account balance and turnovers, they can book the SMS service for 1.50 â¬ per month. This service notifies account holders of all transactions around the clock.Advantages and disadvantages of the netbank business accountAdvantages of the netbank business account are both the favourable account maintenance fee and the 10 free booking items per month. The fee structure is very easy to understand and transparent. Those who are satisfied with a digital account statement also do not have to pay anything for it. If desired, financial software can be integrated as long as it is compatible with HBCI and FinTS. Even more transparency and a comprehensive overview are provided to customers thanks to the SMS service, which provides full information on all expenses and transactions and is available for a small fee of 1.50 per month.Since netbank is a direct bank, it is not possible to visit a branch, which can be a disadvantage for some users. If you want to withdraw money frequently with MasterCard, you will quickly incur high costs, as withdrawals are only possible once a month free of charge. It is therefore advisable to use another credit card to withdraw cash. There are deductions for the fact that netbank does not offer the account for every legal form, but only grants access to freelancers, sole traders and sole entrepreneurs. No overdraft facility is granted for the account; overdraft interest of 13% is charged. It thus corresponds to a credit account. Payments or transfers can only be made if there is a credit balance on the account. If this is the case, however, the fees for transactions are favourable.Open a business account with netbankThe account is opened online. If an account is opened, a preliminary check is carried out on the basis of the information you have provided. This also includes the Schufa check, which enables the account to be opened in an uncomplicated and timely manner. The first prerequisite for opening an account is therefore to provide personal and business data. The PostIdent procedure is required for legitimisation. If the account is then activated, it can be used directly.Conclusion on the netbank business accountSelf-employed and freelancers who exclusively process their transactions online and who only make a few bookings per month benefit from the very attractive and understandable cost structure. The account is well suited for freelancers who primarily need the basic services for a business account. Thanks to the SMS service, customers remain informed about their account balance and movements around the clock, without having to log into online banking. This allows a very pleasant handling of the account and is especially advantageous when you are on business trips. The all-round service in combination with the low fees ensures that the account is a good basis for your business expenses."

                "content": "Penta is a young Berlin start-up that has started to change online banking for freelancers and small and medium-sized businesses. The start-up is not a bank in the classic sense, but a FinTech that is constantly coming onto the market with new services and is therefore particularly interesting for users who are open to innovations in banking and finance. Penta offers the business account in three variants. The Penta Advanced business account is considered the most popular model because it combines the most important services of a corporate account with a reasonable price.Penta Advanced Business Account ServicesThe account allows the processing of all cashless payment transactions at home and abroad through incoming and outgoing transfers. There is no contractual obligation. The basic price includes 100 SEPA transfers per month. A maximum of two users have access to the account, and the number of credit cards is also limited to two.For whom is the Penta Advanced business account suitable?In principle, this account is suitable for all young entrepreneurs. It is particularly suitable for freelancers or start-ups in which two partners are involved in the foundation. Both partners are granted access to online banking, both receive a Mastercard. The Penta Advanced is therefore suitable for companies with the legal form UG or GmbH, if two partners are founding, but also for a partnership under civil law, for a general partnership or for a limited partnership. According to German company law, two shareholders must be involved in these legal forms. The Advanced Account is therefore not only recommended for beginners, but also for companies on a growth course.Prices &amp; Conditions of the Penta Advanced Business AccountThe basic fee is nine Euro per month, a reduction of the costs for founders is not planned. This price includes 100 SEPA transfers per month, each additional transfer costs 0.20 euros. Two users of online banking and Mastercards are also covered in this price. For payments abroad there is a fee of six euros per payment, foreign currency fees amount to 1.50 percent of Pentaâs turnover.Special features of the Penta Advanced business accountIn addition to payment transactions, the young start-up offers a range of other services. These include, for example automated accounting, Transactions in foreign currencies, A payroll accounting, Factoring and an invoicing system.It is also noticeable that the Penta start-up company regularly launches new services that extend the range of services for the business account. Customers are given a say in the development of these services, so that new features can be implemented quickly if the majority of account holders express interest. As a result, it is to be expected that the range of services will be further expanded in the coming years. This makes the account particularly interesting for account holders who are open to new trends in the financial market and who want to use them for themselves and their company.Penta Advanced business account: Advantages and disadvantagesThe Penta Advanced is very suitable for young entrepreneurs who are starting up with a partner. The range of services is consistently tailored to this. The account management remains flexible enough, but also manageable and calculable, so that no disproportionately high costs should arise. At present the withdrawal of cash via bank card is not yet planned. Only Mastercard can be used to withdraw cash at ATMs. This can be impractical for users who need to obtain cash more frequently for their business. The lack of an overdraft facility is also a disadvantage.Open a business account with PentaThe opening of the Penta Advanced is fully digitalized. It takes about ten minutes to enter personal and company data. If there is a shareholdersâ agreement for the company, this must be submitted. The account holder is identified via VideoIdent, which saves the journey to the post office.

With this account, Penta offers this target group interesting services at a reasonable and calculable price.Penta also offers a Basic and a Premium version."

Also a GmbH or a UG in foundation can open the Penta Basic and pay the share capital immediately. The Penta Basic is particularly suitable for freelancers and small to medium-sized companies or start-ups. At the beginning, freelancers or very young companies still have few transactions on their accounts. 50 free bank transfers are sufficient for them, larger companies, on the other hand, are seldom enough.Prices &amp; Conditions of the Penta Basic Business AccountThe account management and Business Mastercard of the Penta Basic are free of charge. A maximum of 50 transfers per month can be made free of charge. Each additional transfer costs 0.20 Euro. The withdrawal of cash with the Business Mastercard is subject to a fee, per transaction two percent of the turnover, the minimum fee is two euros.

This is useful in cases where the main account does not offer a service provided by Penta Basic. It is interesting that customers have a say in the introduction of new functions. The more customers support a new feature, the safer it will be to implement it soon.Advantages and disadvantages of the Penta Basic business accountThe biggest advantage is the clear and transparent price structure. With the free account management and Business Mastercard, all important functions for cashless payment transactions are covered. As it is a credit account, it can also be opened with a Schufa entry. The worldwide supply of cash is guaranteed for a fee. Customer support is offered in German and English.A negative aspect is that it is currently not possible to deposit cash. A disbursement credit is also not set up, therefore the Penta Basic acts as a credit account. Cash withdrawals are subject to a fee.Open Penta Basic Business AccountThe Penta Basic is easy to open online with just a few details. The start-up company does not offer any other options. The registration takes about 15 minutes and includes data about the account holder and his company as well as personal identification by VideoIdent. A passport or identity card is sufficient. If available, the articles of association and the list of shareholders must be presented. Penta activates the account within two banking days. The Mastercard can then be ordered.Conclusion to the Penta Basic business accountPenta Basic consistently dispenses with services that are not absolutely necessary for young companies. This makes it inexpensive and also recommended for freelancers and young start-ups. If you have several users for the account or need a larger scope of services, the two accounts Advanced and Premium from Penta could also be interesting for you."

By issuing several Business Mastercards and providing access to the account for several users, Penta Premium is primarily of interest to companies with several shareholders.Prices &amp; Conditions of the Penta Premium Business AccountFor the Penta Premium business account there is a fee of 19 Euro per month. The credit card is free of charge, for the withdrawal of cash worldwide costs of two percent of the turnover are charged. The minimum fee is two euros.

These include, for example, the execution of transactions in a foreign currency, automated accounting and payroll accounting. Factoring can also be carried out. If desired, the Penta Premium can be used as a second business account. This is useful if a company has already opened a business account that does not offer certain services or offers them for a fee.Penta Premium business account: Advantages and disadvantagesThe clear and unambiguous price structure deserves special mention. The premium account is subject to a fee; the total price covers all costs for account management, for issuing Mastercards and for access by a maximum of five users. The only additional costs are for withdrawing cash with Mastercard. The account holder therefore knows exactly what charges he has to expect in each case. The account is managed on a credit basis, a credit line is not granted. Thus the Penta Premium comes very well into question for account owners, who may not open a business account with credit line due to an entry in the Schufa. The comprehensive customer support in German and English is also a positive feature.Negative is that no cash deposit is possible for the premium account and that no bank card is available. This is due to the fact that the company has no branch structure and does not cooperate with other banks when it comes to cash supply. As Penta is only a FinTech and does not hold a banking licence, it is not possible to set up a overdraft facility, although this may be necessary at the beginning of the business activity.Open Penta Premium Business AccountThe opening of the Premium business account takes about 20 minutes. The account holder must enter his personal data and details of his company. If a shareholder agreement or list of shareholders exists, this must be submitted. The identification takes place via VideoIdent and is done within a few minutes. After two to three bank working days the Penta Premium is opened, so that the Mastercards can be ordered.Conclusion: The Penta Premium Business AccountThe Penta Premium is well suited for young companies that are growing and are looking for an account that is inexpensive and easy to calculate. The cost structure is transparent and understandable, so that you know exactly what fees to expect each month. In addition, Penta consistently does without services that cost money and are not absolutely necessary for a start-up.Other Penta business accounts are Penta Basic and Penta Advanced."

Postbank Giro aktiv plus is suitable for companies that already record a large number of transactions month after month.Postbank business account servicesThe Postbank Giro aktiv plus is subject to a flat monthly fee. The price includes a Postbank Card. A overdraft facility can be granted for the account. Online banking, telephone banking and mobile banking are included. Account statements are sent online, the Business Assistant with additional management tasks is included in the Tablet App. A Visa Card in the Classic or Gold version is also included. Paperless and paper-based bookings are carried out, whereby the cost structure shows that Postbank prefers paperless bookings. Cash can be collected at the counter or alternatively ATMs are available in banks of the cash group.Who is the Postbank Business Giro aktiv plus suitable for?The Postbank Giro aktiv plus is suitable for companies whose number of transactions per month justifies the basic fee. The costs for paperless transactions are very attractive, but the basic fee per month is higher than for other account models.

The account is therefore suitable for self-employed persons whose company is established or who expect a major upturn in the foreseeable future.Postbank Business Giro aktiv plus: Prices &amp; conditionsThe basic fee for the account is 16.90 euros per month, regardless of the amount of the credit balance. The price includes account management, a Postbank Card, a disbursement credit with an interest rate of 7.99 percent per year, the release of online banking with mobile banking and telephone banking and the use of the Business Center for advisory services.

For this clientele, the high basic fee is worthwhile; it is offset by the favorable price for paperless bookings. A further advantage in addition to this attractive fee structure is the combination of online and advisory services, which are often indispensable for business customers.The disadvantage is the high basic fee, which makes the account rather uninteresting for companies that are still growing and that do not achieve a significant number of bookings per month.Open a business account with PostbankIt is possible to open an account online, a visit to the branch is not necessary. For opening an account, only a few data on the account holder and the company are required. The transfer takes place securely and is therefore risk-free for the account holder. Before the account can be used, it must be identified in a post office branch via PostIdent.Conclusion on Postbank Business Giro aktiv plus business accountThe Postbank Giro aktiv plus business account may appeal to established companies that regularly generate a certain turnover and carry out a corresponding number of transactions per month. For these companies, the combination of an online business account with a fairly high basic fee and personal advice is recommended. Those who can do without the extensive services of the Postbank Giro aktiv plus business accounts may be interested in the other two Postbank business accounts: the Postbank Business Giro aktiv or the simple Business Giro business account."

This service is important for companies in growth, but also for established medium-sized companies. The fee structure is relatively complex. In addition, the fees are charged every month and are a significant factor in the long term. If a company has already reached a certain size and achieves regular sales, these costs will not be particularly significant. The situation is different for young companies that are not yet established and do not yet have regular incoming payments. The Business Giro is actively less suitable for these companies.Actively opening Postbank Business GiroThe Business Giro aktiv is opened online on Postbankâs website. The data is transferred via a secure connection. Only a small amount of information is required for the opening. The process is easy to understand and intuitive. After the online opening, identification is required; it can be carried out quickly at the post office branch using PostIdent.Conclusion on the Postbank Business Giro aktiv business accountThis Postbank business account was developed for companies that have already reached a certain size and generate regular sales. For these customers, the account offers an interesting combination of low-cost online services and personal service in the branch. The Postbank Business Giro aktiv plus business account also includes even more services. The Business Giro, on the other hand, is also suitable for freelancers."

Das GrÃ¼ndungskapital der UG betrÃ¤gt dabei jedoch lediglich einen Euro und ist damit viel niedriger als bei der GmbH. Das VermÃ¶gen der Gesellschaft bleibt dabei von dem VermÃ¶gen der Gesellschafter zu trennen. Damit diese Trennung bestehen bleibt, buchen die GrÃ¼nder von Beginn an alle Einnahmen und Ausgaben Ã¼ber ein separates Firmenkonto.Aufgrund des geringen Stammkapitals eignet sich die UG gut fÃ¼r junge Unternehmer, die den Erfolg der eigenen Firma noch nicht genau abschÃ¤tzen kÃ¶nnen. Deshalb legt man in der Anfangszeit oft groÃen Wert auf Ã¼berschaubaren Kosten. Bei der Wahl des GeschÃ¤ftskontos sollte von Beginn an darauf geachtet werden, dass die GebÃ¼hren auf einem niedrigen Niveau gehalten werden.Wie hoch ist das Stammkapital?FÃ¼r die GrÃ¼ndung der UG und die Eintragung in das Handelsregister ist ein Stammkapital in HÃ¶he von einem Euro ausreichend. Bei der GmbH liegt das GrÃ¼ndungskapital hingegen bei 25.000 Euro.Ãblich ist ein Stammkapital zwischen 500 Euro und 1.000 Euro, damit die UG gleich von Anfang an finanzielle Reserven hat, so dass kleinere Anschaffungen gezahlt werden kÃ¶nnen. Die HÃ¶he der Stammeinlagen und die Aufteilung auf die Gesellschafter wird im Gesellschaftsvertrag festgehalten. Dazu kann ein Musterprotokoll verwendet werden, wie es als Download im Internet zur VerfÃ¼gung steht.Was versteht man unter den Stammeinlagen?Die Stammeinlagen sind das Kapital, das jeder einzelne Gesellschafter einbringt. Die HÃ¶he kann zwischen den einzelnen Gesellschaftern vereinbart werden und variieren. Es ist also mÃ¶glich, dass ein Gesellschafter lediglich 40 Prozent des Kapitals einbringt, wÃ¤hrend der andere 60 Prozent zahlt.HÃ¤ufig ist der Gesellschafter mit dem hÃ¶heren Anteil auch derjenige, der die GeschÃ¤fte fÃ¼hrt. Das ist allerdings nicht zwingend vorgeschrieben. Wenn die Gesellschafter nicht Ã¼ber die fachlichen Kenntnisse verfÃ¼gen, um das Unternehmen zu fÃ¼hren, oder wenn sie nicht die nÃ¶tige Zeit dafÃ¼r aufbringen kÃ¶nnen, kann man die Position des GeschÃ¤ftsfÃ¼hrers auch an einen angestellten Mitarbeiter vergeben und ihn mit diese Aufgabe anvertrauen.WofÃ¼r benÃ¶tigt man das GeschÃ¤ftskonto?Ãber das Firmenkonto werden die tÃ¤glichen Geldtransaktionen durchgefÃ¼hrt. Das heiÃt, dass alle Einnahmen und Ausgaben des Unternehmens darÃ¼ber gebucht werden. Somit ist fÃ¼r die UG ein eigenes Firmenkonto erforderlich, das separat von den privaten Konten der GrÃ¼nder zu halten ist. Dadurch ist eine Trennung von privaten und geschÃ¤ftlichen Kosten und Einnahmen sichergestellt.Vor allem lÃ¤sst sich das VermÃ¶gen der Gesellschaft und der Gesellschafter so leichter voneinander abgrenzen. Die Buchhaltung wird auf diesem Weg erleichtert, und fÃ¼r den GrÃ¼nder ist es einfacher, seinen Gewinn oder auch seinen Verlust im Auge zu behalten.Wie wÃ¤hlt man das GeschÃ¤ftskonto aus?Das Angebot an Firmenkonten ist groÃ. Allerdings gibt es nur wenige Banken, die kostenfreie Konten fÃ¼r Unternehmen anbieten. Bevor man sich fÃ¼r einen Anbieter entscheidet, ist es wichtig, sich Ã¼ber die hÃ¤ufigsten Funktionen Gedanken zu machen. Dabei gibt es verschiedene Faktoren zu bedenken.Die UnternehmensgrÃ¼nder sollten unter anderem in etwa wissen, wie viele Buchungen monatlich durchgefÃ¼hrt werden mÃ¼ssen. Handelt es sich dabei um Ãberweisungen auf einem ÃberweisungstrÃ¤ger? Wenn hÃ¤ufig beleghafte Buchungen notwendig sind, fÃ¼r die die Verwaltung durch einen Bankberater voraussetzend ist, macht dies einen groÃen Kostenpunkt aus. Beleglose Buchungen werden von vielen GeschÃ¤ftskontoanbietern kostenlos gewÃ¤hrleistet. Wenn monatlich viele Buchungen anstehen, kann sich auch ein Konto mit JahresgebÃ¼hren anbieten. Denn dafÃ¼r fallen nicht selten die GebÃ¼hren fÃ¼r einzelne Buchungen weg. Oder ist ein kostenloses Konto mit GebÃ¼hren fÃ¼r gelegentliche Buchungen preiswerter?Ein Kontovergleich sollte vor der ErÃ¶ffnung unbedingt durchgefÃ¼hrt werden, damit man die richtige Bank und das passende Konto findet. Stellt man nÃ¤mlich im Lauf der Zeit fest, dass die GebÃ¼hren doch zu hoch sind, ist ein Kontowechsel angesagt. Dieser ist mit groÃem administrativem Aufwand verbunden, den man sich leicht ersparen kann. Bei der ErÃ¶ffnung des Kontos wird das GrÃ¼ndungskapital eingezahlt. Danach kann das Unternehmen ins Handelsregister eingetragen werden.Fazit: FÃ¼r eine UG-GrÃ¼ndung ist ein Firmenkonto nÃ¶tigDie ErÃ¶ffnung eines GeschÃ¤ftskontos ist bei der GrÃ¼ndung einer UG grundlegend und verpflichtend. Dabei sollten Sie unter allen UmstÃ¤nden darauf achten, von Beginn an das passende Konto fÃ¼r den Bedarf des Unternehmens zu identifizieren. Ãber das Firmenkonto werden alle Einnahmen und Ausgaben des jungen Unternehmens durchgefÃ¼hrt. Das Konto sollte zum individuellen Buchungsverhalten passen, um nicht zu einem spÃ¤teren Zeitpunkt einen aufwÃ¤ndigen Kontowechsel erforderlich zu machen."

                "content": "Fees on business accounts Â» You should expect the following costsFees for business accountsCosts and fees for business accountsThe business account is an integral part of daily payment transactions for freelancers and tradespeople, for founders and for established entrepreneurs. After all, payments with suppliers and customers have to be made without cash, employees want their salaries to be transferred and tax payments to the tax office have to be made without cash. Costs and fees play an important role in choosing the right business account. Here the banks differ quite and there are for example only few banks, which offer a free business account. It is worth comparing the fees before you open your business account.Who needs a business account?In principle, founders should open a company account. It makes sense to separate incoming and outgoing payments for your own company from the entire private payment transaction right from the start. This makes your bookkeeping easier and your tax advisor will also be pleased if he only has to check a single company account with the separate bookings for your company. The tax office is also easier to satisfy if you keep the money transactions for your company separately in a separate account.It may be worth opening a current account for private customers for founders and self-employed persons whose business activities are still of a manageable size. However, if your company has already reached a certain size and you regularly generate larger sales or already have employees, you should definitely open a company account with a bank. You will then benefit from special services offered by most banks. Corporate customers are a very lucrative clientele, which is courted by many banks with attractive services. With this in mind, it is understandable that there are only a few providers of free accounts and that you should carefully examine the offers subject to charges.

The differentiation between free and chargeable accounts is a variant. The range of free business accounts is manageable, and you often have to reckon with obligations for such accounts. If you do not meet these requirements, a fee will be charged.The banks also like to differentiate their company accounts according to the target group. For example, there are some accounts that are set up specifically for founders, freelancers or tradespeople. Other accounts are offered specifically for limited liability companies such as the entrepreneurial company with limited liability or the limited liability company. As these legal forms are a company with its own legal personality, the opening of an account is linked to certain requirements. For example, the articles of association must be submitted and, in the case of several shareholders, it must be determined who may dispose of the account.A distinction is also sometimes made between accounts with Schufa queries and accounts without Schufa. In Germany, the opening of an account is linked to the submission of a Schufa information. If you have a negative Schufa entry, you often cannot open an account. In such cases a business account without Schufa query is an option, whereby such accounts are usually somewhat more expensive and are also kept only as a credit account.Business accounts are also differentiated according to the type of bank maintaining the account. Both branch banks and direct banks offer corporate accounts. If you can do without a personal support, a firm account with a direct bank is frequently an inexpensive alternative. If it becomes apparent that you will grow strongly with your company, a branch bank with personal advice is usually the better alternative. Your advisor is then the competent contact for all banking transactions and above all for you, if a financing is necessary for your enterprise.What fees do you have to pay attention to for business accounts?The costs for business accounts depend on the services. It is striking that the fees charged by banks vary greatly. If you are looking for the optimal account for your company, you should first consider what services you need. Then compare the fees your bank charges for these services. In this way, you can find the bank partner that best suits your individual needs with a manageable amount of effort. A distinction must be made between the following fees for account management, for cash withdrawals for the issue of a Maestro and credit card and for the overdraft facility and interest.Account management means the execution of incoming and outgoing money transactions for your account. You receive money from your customer for a delivery or service. If you have to buy goods, you pay money to your supplier. Costs are incurred for the entire operation of your company, whether it is rent for office space, telephone and Internet costs, office supplies, or salaries for your employees. Today, these transactions are usually cashless. Account management includes the execution of these inbound and outbound transactions. Some banks vary their fees according to the number of payments. Such a fee structure is interesting if you make a large number of transfers for your company.As an account holder, you also want to be regularly informed about your account balance. For this purpose, the bank issues a bank statement. If you manage your account via online banking, you instruct many money transactions yourself and also have regular access to your account balance. You may not only make paperless transfers, but from time to time you may also present a cheque deposit or a transfer in voucher form. Processing fees may apply.If you occasionally wish to withdraw cash from your company account, you will need a Maestro or EC card. This card is issued by your bank and is often subject to a charge. Withdrawing cash from an ATM can also cost money. Some banks offer one or two free withdrawals per month and each additional withdrawal costs money. The card can be used by some banks to deposit money into your account, but some banks charge fees for this as well.If you need a credit card for your business, you may have to pay an annual fee. A transaction fee is also charged for withdrawing cash in other currencies from ATMs abroad or paying in foreign currencies. There are significant differences between banks. If you frequently pay by credit card, you should take a closer look at the charges. The fees are charged as a percentage of the amount. So the higher the amount withdrawn, the higher the transaction costs.What about free business accounts?Especially for founders and self-employed people at the beginning of their career, the cost of the account plays an important role. If the revenue is not yet flowing regularly, try to keep the expenses for your company within manageable limits. Free business accounts are very popular against this backdrop. Some direct banks offer checking accounts for private customers, which you can also use as a founder or freelancer. These accounts cover all important services such as account management with the execution of bank transfers and direct debits and the provision of bank statements. These accounts are often managed via online banking. As soon as your business is of a certain size, so that you might even want to take out a loan for your company, you should switch to a corporate account. Although this is usually more expensive, you will also benefit from the comprehensive advisory services of your local personal bank advisor.Conclusion: Fees are an important factor when comparing accountsAlthough the range of business accounts is not as extensive as for private accounts, you should compare the conditions before opening an account. There is a wide range of offers on the market and banks vary widely in their fees. Before opening an account, it is therefore worth checking exactly what services you need for your company and which bank you can find the right offer from."

                "content": "Interest on business and private accountsAnyone who speaks of interest for current or business accounts should first clearly differentiate between debit and credit interest. Debit interest is incurred for a overdraft or overdraft credit, credit interest is granted for a credit on the account. As with private accounts, there are also considerable differences from bank to bank for company accounts. While debit interest on loans is a significant factor and plays a role in choosing a provider, credit interest should not be the decisive factor.What types of interest are there?In principle, debit interest and credit interest must be distinguished. The bank charges debit interest as a fee if the account holder overdraws his account. In the case of a private account, this is referred to as a overdraft facility. If the credit line granted is overdrawn, this is an overdraft facility. Both the overdraft and the overdraft credit are expensive financings, the debit interest varies strongly from bank to bank. Due to the amount of the borrowing interest, a overdraft facility and an overdraft facility should never be exhausted permanently or in full. The situation is similar with the working capital loan, which corresponds to the overdraft facility for a business account. The establishment of a working capital loan by the bank requires the account holder to have an impeccable credit rating. Above all, before approving the loan, you must submit a credit report and proof of your last income. In this way, the bank checks your creditworthiness before setting up the credit line for your company account.Interest on credit balances must be distinguished from interest on debit balances. They are generally granted if there is a credit balance on your current account. Due to the European Central Bankâs ongoing policy of low interest rates, most banks no longer offer credit interest on private accounts. This is not always the case with commercial banks. If you value interest on the credit balance on your company account, you should check the conditions of the banks carefully and also keep an eye on the other conditions such as costs for account management, for the credit card or for the working capital loan.What is the difference in interest on business accounts?Interest can be paid on a company account balance. In this case, the bank will pay interest on the balance you have in your business account. These interest rates are low given the low key interest rates of the European Central Bank and can almost be neglected in comparison. On average, they range between 0.01 percent and 0.05 percent. Interest is paid on credit balances from the first euro. Payment is usually made every quarter, but also at the end of the half-year or only once a year at the end of the year.In addition there is credit interest, if the current account is coupled to an overnight money account. To do this, you must transfer your credit balance on the business account to the call money account. The online banking that most banks offer for a business account means that this can be done quickly. You can, for example, transfer the available balance to the call account at the end of the month and then receive an interest credit month after month, per quarter or at the end of the year. Many banks keep the credit interest on the call money account variable and adjust it according to the key interest rate. It is also possible that the interest is only granted for a certain period of several months or that the interest rate is staggered depending on the amount of the credit. The more credits you have accumulated, the lower the interest rates on the credits will often be.There is another variant of the credit interest rate for money that is saved on the credit card. This interest corresponds approximately to the credit interest for the overnight money account. Not all banks offer this alternative, so you should take a close look at the conditions. For many account holders it is more practical to save credit on the call money account, because it is available there at any time. Straight ones for reserves, which are meant for the bridging of liquidity bottlenecks, are well suitable the daily money account despite its very small interest. It is comfortable, safe, usually free of charge and the money can be called up at any time.Frequency of interest payment on business accountsAs a rule, interest is credited per year. The interest is usually paid out at the end of the year in the first days of the following year. Some banks offer monthly or quarterly payments. The more often interest is paid out, the stronger the compound interest effect. It means that the interest paid continues to bear interest. In principle, this is of course a desirable effect, so that a monthly interest payment is the best option. In practice the frequency of the interest payment is lessWhich banks still offer credit interest?The banks set the interest rates for a current account or an overnight money account depending on the key interest rate of the European Central Bank. This has been zero since the beginning of 2016. This means that a bank itself does not receive interest on deposits with the ECB. As a result, it also grants its investors only very low interest rates for a credit balance in a call money account or a current account. This explains why there are currently so few banks that offer credit interest on a private or business account and why the interest rate on overnight money is so low.If you are nevertheless interested in an interest rate on the credit balance and if all other conditions are right, you can of course choose a provider with a low interest rate for credit balances. The banks change their interest rates occasionally, so itâs worth comparing conditions. In addition to the fees and the interest for the credit line, you should also consider the interest on the credit balance.Santander Bank offers interest on some accounts. Also the Ziraat bank from Turkey chooses a small interest for its combination account, whereby it concerns here a combination of a Giro and an overnight money account. It is important to know that the bank is based in Turkey. The supply with cash is secured Germany far over foreign banks, for it however fees result.Also the ING makes a business account with daily money account available for new customers. The interest is fixed for a certain period, afterwards a reduced market interest takes effect. In addition, it only applies up to a fixed amount. In the case of larger investment amounts, a reduced interest rate applies again.Advanzia Bank also offers a very good interest rate for a minimum investment of EUR 5,000, which in turn is limited in time. Other banks that you can consider in the comparison are Consorsbank and Renault BankDirekt. If you are interested in one of the major banks in Germany, it is worth taking a look at the conditions offered by Hypovereinsbank. The WillkommensKonto Business, for example, offers interest that is graduated by amount. The amount of interest depends on the amount of the balance. For business customers whose account has an average balance of between 30,000 and 75,000 euros, the interest rates are quite attractive. You should also keep an eye on the Berliner Bank, where there are quite interesting interest rates, as long as your balance on the account is not higher than 30,000 euros.Conclusion: Credit interest does not play a role in the account comparisonSince the interest rates for credit balances at most banks have been at a low level for some years both for business accounts and for private accounts, this criterion plays at best a subordinate role in the account comparison. The situation is different for interest rates on loans. These interest rates represent the costs that you have to pay for a working capital loan. Here the conditions of the banks vary enormously, so that you should pay the necessary attention to this aspect with the account comparison."

                "content": "&nbsp;In principle, a business account is recommended for all self-employed persons in order to cleanly separate business and private payment transactions. This also applies to part-time workers, whose business may still have a manageable size. The offers for business accounts are as varied as for private current accounts. Before you open an account, you should therefore compare the conditions very closely.Who needs a business account?Especially for self-employed people who are still at the very beginning of their professional development, it is often not clear why they should open a separate account for their business payment transactions. If you donât have regular income yet, you can book occasional incoming payments very well through your private account. Especially part-timers like to use the private account to save themselves the effort of opening a company account, if they donât know yet whether their business idea is crowned with success in the long run and if they expand their independence.Nevertheless, regardless of the extent of their self-employment, tradespeople and freelancers should pay attention from the outset to separating the business and private deposits and withdrawals. This will make it easier for you to settle your own accounts, as it will give you a better overview of the development of your business. It is also easier for the tax office to check your accounts.As a self-employed person, you can in principle open a company account or use an additional private checking account. This is particularly useful if the scope of your business activities is still manageable. A company account may open freelancers and tradesmen as well as enterprises. These include above all the civil-law partnership, the limited liability company, the limited liability company, the public limited company, the general partnership and the limited partnership.Who is obliged to open a business account?There are some legal forms that are legally obliged to open a separate company account for their operational payment transactions. These include, in particular, the legal forms with a limitation of liability such as the entrepreneurial company with a limited liability, the limited liability company or the stock corporation. For all other legal forms this legal regulation does not exist.The limited liability company forms are corporations. They have their own legal personality and are only legally capable of acting as a company if the founding capital has been paid into the company account and if the payment has been confirmed by the notary. In addition, the entry in the commercial register must be completed. Against this background, the opening of a company account is of particular importance in these legal forms, as it is in principle part of the establishment.What should I pay attention to when choosing a business account?Before you decide on a bank, you should take a close look at the conditions. As you are likely to want to use your business account for a long time, it should fit your needs. Therefore, first consider what services your account should provide. Most self-employed people, for example, attach great importance to online banking and an EC card. A credit card can be dispensable, a overdraft facility or an overdraft facility does not have to be granted to self-employed persons at the outset. On the other hand, a branch of the bank near your place of residence can be very interesting if you occasionally want personal advice.Once you have determined what is important to you with your business account, look at the conditions of the providers near you or on the Internet. Pay particular attention to the charges for maintaining the account and for making transfers with and without a receipt. Check the interest rate on the overdraft facility if you want to set up a credit line for your account. Take a close look at whether your preferred bank offers corporate accounts for any legal form or whether there are exceptions. Analyze the terms and conditions of corporate financing so that you are well prepared when needed.Based on this information, it should be quite easy to find the right corporate account. In an online comparison, these data are, by the way, compiled quite clearly and easily understandable, so that you can see at a glance which bank requires which conditions.What documents do you need to open an account?You will need some documents to open your business account. They vary slightly from bank to bank. It also depends on the legal form of your business which documents you need to present. It is best to ask your bank for the required documents in advance. This will save you two ways if you do not have all the necessary information at your first appointment with your bank advisor. The actual application for opening an account is made online at most banks. If this is not desired, arrange a personal appointment with a bank advisor.One of the most important documents for opening an account is your identity card. It serves to establish your identity. As an alternative to an identity card, a passport is usually also recognised. Your identity card contains all the important personal data that the bank needs from you. This includes your surname and first name, address, place of birth, size, eye colour and nationality.The second important document is the Schufa information. The Schufa documents all incidents about you that are of any relevance for loans and other payment obligations. At best, your Schufa is flawless, that is, there are no negative entries. Such negative data includes, above all, reminder and enforcement notices or other information that suggests that you have not fulfilled your payment obligations in accordance with the contract.Proof of income is also required by some banks. This is especially true if you go into business for yourself on a part-time basis. In most cases, the last three statements of wages or salaries are sufficient. If you are self-employed and already receive income, you should of course also provide proof of this. This may even require a tax assessment. If your company has been on the market for some time, the bank may require the last balance sheets and profit and loss accounts. Under certain circumstances, a surplus income statement can be requested. Together with the latest statements of account at your previous bank, such documents serve to prove your creditworthiness. This is particularly important if you want to apply for a loan or set up an overdraft facility for your account.As a trader, you must submit your business registration, and the tax number of the tax office may also be requested. If you set up a corporation such as a GmbH or an entrepreneurial company with limited liability, it is essential that you bring the articles of association with you when opening an account. The most important documents for opening a business account: Identity card/passport Schufa information Proof of income (if applicable) If applicable, balance sheets/profit and loss accounts If applicable, last account statements of the previous bank Business registration, if applicable Tax number of the tax office if applicable Possible articles of association (e.g. for a GmbH or UG (limited liability))How long does it take to open a business account?If you submit your application online, you will usually receive a legitimation request a few business days later. This is often done using the PostIdent procedure, some banks also offer the faster VideoIdent procedure. It takes a few more working days for the account to be opened and for you to receive all the access data after authentication. On average, you should expect two weeks before you can use your account to its full extent.Conclusion: A business account makes sense for all self-employed personsEven if the volume of your business is still manageable, you should separate your business payment transactions from your private processes. Open a business account for this purpose. If you still generate little income, your company account can be a private current account.Some banks even offer free business accounts, the services are sufficient for most self-employed people at the beginning of their activity. If you want comprehensive personal advice, a company account with a local branch bank is usually the better choice, even if the costs of account management are somewhat higher.You should allow up to two weeks for your account to open before it can be fully used. You can speed up the process by submitting all the necessary documents for the bank at the first appointment."

                "content": "German business account overdraftCurrent account credit for business accountsBoth as a founder and as an established entrepreneur, you are familiar with the situation: you temporarily find yourself in a financial bottleneck. Maybe a customer did not pay as expected, maybe you unexpectedly had to pay a large bill. To compensate for your bottleneck, you want to overdraw your account. If your business account has an overdraft facility, that shouldnât be a problem. This credit is specially designed to bridge short-term liquidity bottlenecks. However, it is also quite expensive and should therefore only be used temporarily and not in full. What, then, is the current account credit all about?What is a current account credit?The overdraft facility for your business account is similar to the overdraft facility for your personal account. It is an overdraft facility that you can use at any time. The prerequisite for this is that the bank sets up this overdraft facility. This means that the bank must allow you to bring your account into deficit up to an agreed contract. As soon as there is income on your account again, the current account credit is settled.You pay interest for the duration of the drawdown and for the respective amount. This interest rate is relatively high compared to classic installment loans. Against this background, you should never use your current account credit permanently or to the full amount agreed with the bank. An overdraft facility is only a suitable form of financing for short periods of time and for small sums.What are the differences between overdrafts and overdrafts?An overdraft facility differs from a overdraft facility essentially only in the type of account for which it is set up. The overdraft facility is granted for the checking account of private customers. As a private customer, you usually receive regular income from a permanent employment relationship. The overdraft facility can be repaid from this income.Pensioners or even unemployed persons can also receive a disbursement credit in an appropriate amount, because with the pension and the unemployment benefit there is a certain fixed receipt of money. However, the amount of the overdraft depends heavily on your regular income. Some banks grant a loan of two to three monthsâ income. As the overdraft facility is expensive, you should consider whether such a high credit line is really necessary or whether you would be better advised to take a smaller amount.The current account credit is also a tolerated overdraft facility, but it is granted for your company account. The amount of the overdraft facility is again agreed with the bank and you pay interest for the drawdown. You pay interest according to the amount in which you have used the credit and according to the duration. It is calculated in days, so that you are billed exactly to the day. The interest rates for the overdraft facility or overdraft facility are relatively high by comparison. Although credit interest rates on the market have fallen steadily in recent years, some banks still charge double-digit interest on overdrafts. Interest rate cuts are therefore only very hesitantly passed on to private and business customers.Typical transactions for which the current account credit is claimed are the purchase of goods by self-employed persons although there are still outstanding payments from customers or the use of a cash discount granted by a supplier. Paying wages and salaries to employees can also mean that the account has to be overdrawn when sales are not yet made.Do founders get an overdraft?Usually it becomes very difficult for founders to overdraw their business account. This is mainly due to the fact that the bank is not yet able to assess how a founderâs business will develop in terms of sales and profits. This makes it very difficult to assess whether the loan will be repaid. As a founder, you should also consider whether you want to get into debt at short notice in order to bridge a payment bottleneck.What are the requirements for a current account credit?As a self-employed person, you must expect to undergo an extensive credit check before your loan application is approved by the bank. The analysis of your creditworthiness is at the forefront of the credit check. The bank will check your creditworthiness on the basis of the last turnover and the profit. It will probably want to see your latest tax assessments, profit and loss accounts and balance sheets. For freelancers, the surplus income statement is sufficient. In addition, she will probably demand an extract from the Schufa to check whether you have fulfilled your payment obligations.Welche Kosten fallen fÃ¼r den Kredit an?FÃ¼r einen Kontokorrentkredit fallen wie fÃ¼r jeden anderen Kredit Zinsen an. Diese werden nach der HÃ¶he des Betrags berechnet, Ã¼ber den Sie den Kreditrahmen in Anspruch nehmen. AuÃerdem spielt die LÃ¤nge des Zeitraums eine Rolle, fÃ¼r den Sie den Kredit nutzen. Die Zinsen fÃ¼r den Kontokorrentkredit unterscheiden sich bei den Banken sehr stark, doch prinzipiell sind sie deutlich hÃ¶her als die Kosten fÃ¼r einen Ratenkredit. Manche Banken verlangen sogar einen Zins im zweistelligen Bereich. Das heiÃt, dass Sie als Kreditnehmer von den aktuell geringen Zinsen am Kreditmarkt bei einem Kontokorrentkredit kaum profitieren. Vor diesem Hintergrund sollten Sie die Zinsen fÃ¼r diesen Kredit unbedingt vergleichen und Ihr Firmenkonto auch nach der HÃ¶he der Zinsen fÃ¼r den Kontokorrentkredit auswÃ¤hlen.Wie beantragen Sie einen Kontokorrentkredit?Den Ãberziehungsrahmen fÃ¼r Ihr Konto beantragen Sie bei Ihrer Bank, bei der Sie das GeschÃ¤ftskonto fÃ¼hren. Bevor Sie den Kreditantrag stellen, sprechen Sie am besten mit Ihrem Berater und vereinbaren mit ihm, in welcher HÃ¶he der Kredit sinnvoll eingerichtet wird. Er hilft Ihnen dabei, den Rahmen sinnvoll zu bemessen und berÃ¼cksichtigt dabei auch die weitere Entwicklung Ihres GeschÃ¤fts. So kÃ¶nnen Sie verhindern, dass Sie nach einiger Zeit einen weiteren Antrag auf Kreditgenehmigung stellen mÃ¼ssen.Der Kreditrahmen soll einerseits nicht zu hoch bemessen sein, damit Ihre Zinszahlungen Ã¼berschaubar bleiben. Andererseits soll er so angelegt sein, dass Sie Ihren Zahlungsverpflichtungen nachkommen kÃ¶nnen. Am besten vereinbaren Sie den Kreditrahmen mit Ihrer Bank zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem er noch nicht nÃ¶tig ist. Dann wird Ihre BonitÃ¤t besser bewertet, und Sie haben keinen zeitlichen Druck, den Kreditrahmen sofort einrichten zu mÃ¼ssen. Das erleichtert Ihnen die Verhandlung mit Ihrer Bank. Ihr Bankberater wird Ihnen auch erklÃ¤ren, welche Unterlagen Sie fÃ¼r die Kreditgenehmigung benÃ¶tigen.Welche Alternativen gibt es zum Kontokorrentkredit?Eine interessante Alternative zum Kontokorrentkredit ist der Mikrokredit. Er ist ebenfalls zur ÃberbrÃ¼ckung von kurzfristigen finanziellen EngpÃ¤ssen gedacht und wird auch nur in einer begrenzten HÃ¶he ausgestellt. Gerade fÃ¼r GrÃ¼nder ist es zu empfehlen, eine solide und durchdachte Finanzplanung zu erstellen. Wenn nÃ¶tig, kÃ¶nnen Sie dann einen FÃ¶rderkredit aufnehmen. Diese Finanzierungen sind speziell fÃ¼r GrÃ¼nder konzipiert und deutlich preiswerter als ein Kontokorrentkredit.Fazit: Der Kontokorrentkredit ist bequem, aber teuerEin Kontokorrentkredit beim GeschÃ¤ftskonto ist prinzipiell gut geeignet, wenn Sie kurzfristig einen LiquiditÃ¤tsengpass Ã¼berbrÃ¼cken mÃ¼ssen. Er wird als Ãberziehungsrahmen fÃ¼r Ihr GeschÃ¤ftskonto gewÃ¤hrt und wird genutzt, wenn Sie eine Rechnung zahlen wollen und auf dem Konto kein Guthaben vorhanden ist. Mit dem nÃ¤chsten Geldeingang wird das Ã¼berzogene Konto wieder ausgeglichen. Damit erhÃ¶ht der Kontokorrentkredit Ihren finanziellen Spielraum.Allerdings handelt es sich dabei um einen sehr teuren Kredit. Deshalb sollten Sie ihn keinesfalls langfristig oder in voller HÃ¶he in Anspruch nutzen, denn fÃ¼r diesen Zweck gibt es gÃ¼nstigere Kredite mit niedrigeren Zinsen. FÃ¼r GrÃ¼nder kommt der Kontokorrentkredit meist nicht in Frage, weil viele Banken die BonitÃ¤t sehr vorsichtig bewerten und deshalb keinen Ãberziehungsrahmen einrichten."
