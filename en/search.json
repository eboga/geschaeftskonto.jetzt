In Germany, sole traders, tradesmen and freelancers, managing directors of a pre-GmbH and a GmbH and the shareholders of an entrepreneurial company can open an account.

If a payment is outstanding, the account holder receives a reminder and can initiate the dunning procedure.Advantages and disadvantages of the Holvi Grower business accountIn addition to the unlimited execution of cashless transfers for a small basic fee and the integrated IT tool for invoice verification, the optional online shop is a big plus for customers who want to offer sales via their Internet presence. The shop can be set up with just a few details to save time.The biggest disadvantage of the business account is certainly that no overdraft facility is set up. This means that temporary payment bottlenecks cannot be bridged. Instead, the account holder must ensure himself that his account has a credit balance. The relatively high fees for withdrawing cash are also disadvantageous if cash is frequently withdrawn from the business account. These costs can be avoided by adding an account with free cash withdrawal to the Holvi Grower business account.Open a Holvi Grower business accountThe Holvi Grower account is opened online.

    "content"     : "Kontist is a start-up company from Berlin and therefore not a commercial bank in the classical sense. The company acts as FinTech and provides an account, but it does not act as the account-holding bank. This task lies with Solaris Bank, which also has its headquarters in Berlin. Kontist’s approach is interesting in principle, because with a free account the account holder receives a largely free account in which services are reduced to the essential aspects for freelancers and tradespeople.Services of the Kontist Free Business AccountAn app is offered for account management. The account holder is informed about all account movements via push messages and is kept up to date on his account balance in real time. Sub-accounts or a second current account cannot be set up per customer. In addition to the already included virtual credit card, a plastic credit card for the business account is optionally available. It is managed on a credit basis. The bank does not grant a credit line for the Mastercard nor an overdraft credit for the account. Cash deposits are not offered, a credit can only be deposited by means of bank transfers to the account.For whom is the Kontist Free business account suitable?The Kontist Free Business Account is especially suitable for professionals and freelancers who are still at the beginning of their professional development and who do not yet have any employees. Legal entities such as the Unternehmergesellschaft haftungsbeschränkt or the GmbH are not allowed to use Kontist Free at the moment.Prices &amp;amp; Conditions of the Kontist Free Business AccountAccount management with Kontist Free is free of charge. There are also no fees for booking items. Costs are incurred if a return debit note is booked or if research orders have to be placed. These services are not part of the usual banking routine and are therefore subject to charges.The plastic credit card is charged at an annual rate of 29 euros, the virtual credit card is already included. If the turnover on the plastic card exceeds 3,000 euros, the annual fee is waived. Payments in a foreign currency cost 1.7 percent of the turnover. Two euros are payable for each cash withdrawal with the credit card. The card turnover of 120,000 euros per year may not be exceeded. This framework should be sufficient for self-employed persons who do not yet run a company that is too large.Special features of the Kontist Free business accountKontist Free is a creation-free account. The account holder does not have to provide any Schufa information. This is rather rare for business accounts, but can be advantageous for self-employed persons who cannot open a business account with an overdraft limit due to a Schufa entry.Another special feature are the additional services, because Kontist offers a quite extensive accounting function for the account, which a self-employed person would otherwise have to buy from another provider. Both for the bookkeeping and for the calculation production partner programs are available, with which the business account can be linked. Kontist then classifies each entry in the accounting, the process runs with the help of the learning program more and more accurately. This saves the self-employed an enormous amount of time, which they no longer have to spend on their bookkeeping. Anyone who has hitherto employed a tax consultant can significantly reduce these costs.Advantages and disadvantages of the Kontist Free business accountThe Kontist Free is reduced to the essential services such as the actual account management and the processing of cashless payment transactions. This means that essential functions are covered free of charge. The account is also suitable for self-employed persons who are not allowed to open an account with a credit line due to a Schufa entry. However, the disadvantage is that no overdraft facility is granted.Open Kontist Free Business AccountThe account is opened digitally, the PostIdent procedure is replaced by a voice function and video identification. For the opening, the most important personal data must be kept ready, and the tax identification number must also be provided. If desired, the PostIdent procedure can also be used for identification."

    "content"     : "Behind Kontist is a FinTech start-up based in Berlin. The company itself does not have a licence to offer banking services, but cooperates with Solaris Bank. Kontist offers a business account in two variants. The Kontist Free is a business account that offers free account management and a virtual MasterCard. It is therefore suitable for all those who can limit their business account to these essential services. If you are looking for a little more performance, choose the Kontist Premium account. Although it costs a little more, it offers many advantages by being linked to accounting software.Kontist Premium Business Account ServicesThe Kontist Premium business account primarily offers account management via the app. This allows free transfers to be made. In addition there is a free virtual and a physical credit card if the account holder wishes this. The account holder is informed of his account balance at all times via real-time notifications.It is possible to set up sub-accounts for the premium account and thus clearly separate individual business transactions from each other. Very interesting is the coupling with the accounting and the tax program. A tax calculation can be created for the premium account at any time. Automatic reserve accounts ensure the creation of reserves for a wide variety of purposes without the account holder having to think about it.Who is the Kontist Premium business account suitable for?The Kontist Premium is primarily intended for the self-employed who want an all-inclusive package for their financial transactions and who want to be supported in their accounting. This is not only for freelancers and tradespeople who already achieve a certain turnover with their business, but also for small companies that employ only a few people.Prices &amp;amp; Conditions of the Kontist Premium Business AccountFor the Kontist Premium business account there is a basic fee of nine Euro per month. There is no minimum contract period, the account can be cancelled at any time. This price includes a Mastercard for which no basic fee is payable. Only for current transactions such as cash withdrawals or payments in foreign currencies is a fee charged as a percentage of the turnover. This makes the costs transparent and comprehensible for the account holder at all times. There are no hidden fees.Special features of the Kontist Premium business accountOne of the most important additional services of the premium account is the link to the accounting department. Based on this, the tax calculation program calculates how many reserves are to be formed for tax or other expenses. At the same time, it calculates how much financial leeway the account holder can make use of.These clever services are taken over by a tax consultant for many self-employed people. With Kontist Premium, you can at least partially save the advice of a tax expert and thus also significantly reduce costs and time for administrative tasks.Advantages and disadvantages of the Kontist Premium business accountOne of the major advantages is the transparent cost structure. Also the quick opening without personal legitimation by PostIdent is to be welcomed. The fact that the account is not subject to a disposition framework can have a negative effect. If expenses are incurred, the account must have a credit balance and, if necessary, be topped up beforehand.Open Kontist Premium Business AccountThe business account can be opened completely online on request. If desired, the PostIdent procedure can be replaced by a video legitimation. This means that the opening is completed within a short time and the account is available with all its functions. Also comprehensive documents are not to be submitted, so that the administrative expenditure keeps itself within limits.Conclusion on the Kontist Premium business accountKontist’s premium account is particularly interesting due to its comprehensive additional services such as the link to accounting and tax calculation. As a self-employed person, you receive all the essential services that require a lot of time and a certain amount of specialist knowledge or that have to be assigned to a tax expert. In return, the self-employed person pays a transparently calculated fee so that he knows each month how high his basic fee is. Only the costs for payments by credit card are added to the Kontist Premium business account."

    "content"     : "N26 offers the business account in three different variants. While the business account in the classic form is intended for business customers who are looking for a free account that fulfils all essential services, the N26 Business You business account with its black Mastercard goes a little further.It is primarily interesting for business people who often travel abroad. The premium product “Metal” offers the complete service package with selected partner offers, but is even more expensive. In this respect, the N26 product range covers the individual needs of business customers with a wide variety of requirements.Services of the N26 Business You business accountThe basic services of N26’s business account include the withdrawal of cash in euro and payment in all currencies. Cash withdrawals are also possible worldwide in any currency. A black Mastercard is linked to the You account. It guarantees a comprehensive service package for various insurance companies that are interesting when travelling.The Allianz insurer covers treatment costs when travelling abroad in the case of acute illnesses as well as injuries after accidents when travelling. Expenses are reimbursed for flight delays if the delay exceeds four hours. Late delivery of baggage is also reimbursable if it exceeds four hours. Smartphone and cash theft is refundable. Mastercard insurance coverage is valid all over the world.Who can use the N26 Business You business account?The N26 Business You business account is particularly suitable for self-employed people who travel frequently for business reasons.

The Allianz insurance package is also included in the price, there are no additional costs for insurance coverage.Special features of the N26 Business You business accountThe most important feature of the N26 Business You business account is certainly the integrated insurance protection for the account holder.

Otherwise, it may happen that a service you expect is not provided and that you have to pay the costs of an insured event out of your own pocket.Advantages and disadvantages of the N26 Business You Business AccountThe biggest advantage of the account is certainly the integrated insurance cover abroad. As a rule, such benefits are only included in the price of premium class accounts. If you are frequently abroad, it is worth checking the insurance conditions more closely and making use of this service. Disadvantageous are the general restrictions that N26 provides for business customers. For example, it is not possible to open another account for private use only.All advantages of the N26 Business Business Account at a glance  Free payment in any currency  Transactions in real time as push message to mobile phone  Export of all transactions as CSV file  Automatic categorization of all issues  Transactions in real time as push message to mobile phone  Web app and mobile phone app available  Online invoice tools can be integrated  Travel insurance included (treatment costs on trips abroad in case of acute illnesses as well as injuries after accidents on trips)  Reimbursement for flight or baggage delays of more than 4 hours  Insurance cover for theft of smartphones and cash  Mastercard insurance coverage worldwideOpen a business account with N26The account opening is done within a few minutes on the website.

    "content"     : "N26 is one of the young providers of banking services. The company was not founded until 2013. The aim was to offer mobile banking at a reasonable price. The aim was to address either private or business customers. The preferred target group today is the self-employed who want a free checking account with the most important basic services.Services of the N26 Business Business AccountThe Business Business Account of N26 covers the most important services for freelancers. Withdrawing cash from ATMs in euros is free of charge, as is paying in any currency. There is an attractive cashback system for purchases, provided they have been paid for via the account. Private and business payment transactions can be processed jointly via the account. To use the free Business Mastercard, all transactions are sent in real time as a push message to the mobile phone. In this way, card payments, transfers and direct debits are displayed and automatically divided into categories.For whom is the N26 Business Business Account suitable?The N26 Business Account is suitable for self-employed and freelancers who want to use their account primarily for business purposes. If you want to open an account with N26, you are not yet allowed to be a customer of the provider. This means that the parallel use of a private and a business account is not possible. In addition, the main residence is limited to one of the countries where N26 is currently on the market. These include, among others, Germany and Austria.Prices &amp;amp; Conditions of the N26 Business Business AccountN26’s business account is free. Account maintenance fees are not charged. Transfers to foreign accounts are made via TransferWise and are therefore much cheaper than with traditional commercial banks.Features of the N26 Business Business AccountA cashback of 0.1 percent is granted on all purchases made with the Business Mastercard. Since it is not possible to have a private and a business account with N26, there is a good alternative. Both private and business expenses are paid through the same account. With Mastercard, all business expenses are paid. If you also want a card for private payments, order the Maestro card in the app. The private costs are then paid via the Maestro card. In this way you benefit from the business and private advantages of the N26 business account. The only important thing is that you mainly use the current account for your business.Advantages and disadvantages of the N26 Business Business AccountThe big advantage of the N26 business account is certainly the slim power spectrum in combination with the low price. If you can reduce the benefits of your business account to a minimum, you will be rewarded with a very attractive price. The sending of push messages in real time and the categorisation of expenses are also interesting features. They help you keep your costs under control and control expenses more easily.The disadvantage is that it is currently not possible to be a private or business customer at N26. Paying for private expenses with the optional Maestro card is one way to pay for private and business expenses through an account. However, this should only work if you have little to pay privately.All advantages of the N26 Business Business Account at a glance  No account maintenance fee  Free payment in any currency  Free Business Mastercard  0.1% cashback on all purchases with Business Mastercard  Transactions in real time as push message to mobile phone  Automatic categorization of all issues  Web app and mobile phone app available  Export of all transactions as CSV file  For private and business useOpen a business account with the N26The opening of the account is done online, with only a few details. To register, you need to enter your first and last name. This ensures that a freelancer only registers if he/she performs his/her duties in his/her own name. The company name is therefore not visible on the account or on the card. To open an account, all you need is a PC or smartphone and no paper is required.Conclusion on the N26 Business business accountThis business account is ideal for freelancers who focus on the basic services of a current account and want to pay little for them. It is recommended that all private payment transactions be made through a separate account with another bank and not mixed."

    "content"     : "Services of the netbank business accountThe netbank business account offers a low-cost account management including online banking. Cash can be withdrawn at around 2.5 million ATMs with the MasterCard logo when MasterCard is added. Digital account statements or the SMS service provide information on the account balance. The account thus covers all the important functions of a company account. Extra services such as sub-accounts, SMS service and MasterCard can be booked individually for a low fee.For whom is the netbank business account suitable?The netbank wants to address freelancers, sole traders and sole traders with its account. The target group are self-employed people who run their business as a partnership and therefore need a manageable business operation. By the possibility of opening further subaccounts, customers can keep still better the overview of expenditures and incomes. The corporate account can be opened by business customers from any industry - either in the name of the customer or in the name of the (legally responsible) company.Prices &amp;amp; conditions of the netbank business accountSince 1 October 2019, netbank has been offering its business customers a new account model: Until now, it was possible to choose between the basic and the premium business account. From October 2019, netbank will offer only one business account, which combines the conditions of the previous models. With an account management fee of € 4.85 per month (€ 58.20 per year) and 10 free booking items included, this is a low-cost company account. Each additional voucherless booking costs customers € 0.15, card transactions with the MasterCard do not count as booking items.The MasterCard Debit Business can be optionally booked in addition and is available for an annual fee of 10 euros. The same conditions apply to partner and additional cards. The credit card can be used to withdraw cash at over 2.5 million ATMs worldwide. One ATM use per month is free of charge, each further withdrawal costs €3.Optionally, sub-accounts can also be added by the account holder, whereby the costs for each sub-account amount to € 2.50 per month. So that customers always keep the overview of account balance and turnovers, they can book the SMS service for 1.50 € per month. This service notifies account holders of all transactions around the clock.Advantages and disadvantages of the netbank business accountAdvantages of the netbank business account are both the favourable account maintenance fee and the 10 free booking items per month. The fee structure is very easy to understand and transparent. Those who are satisfied with a digital account statement also do not have to pay anything for it. If desired, financial software can be integrated as long as it is compatible with HBCI and FinTS. Even more transparency and a comprehensive overview are provided to customers thanks to the SMS service, which provides full information on all expenses and transactions and is available for a small fee of 1.50 per month.Since netbank is a direct bank, it is not possible to visit a branch, which can be a disadvantage for some users. If you want to withdraw money frequently with MasterCard, you will quickly incur high costs, as withdrawals are only possible once a month free of charge. It is therefore advisable to use another credit card to withdraw cash. There are deductions for the fact that netbank does not offer the account for every legal form, but only grants access to freelancers, sole traders and sole entrepreneurs. No overdraft facility is granted for the account; overdraft interest of 13% is charged. It thus corresponds to a credit account. Payments or transfers can only be made if there is a credit balance on the account. If this is the case, however, the fees for transactions are favourable.Open a business account with netbankThe account is opened online. If an account is opened, a preliminary check is carried out on the basis of the information you have provided. This also includes the Schufa check, which enables the account to be opened in an uncomplicated and timely manner. The first prerequisite for opening an account is therefore to provide personal and business data. The PostIdent procedure is required for legitimisation. If the account is then activated, it can be used directly.Conclusion on the netbank business accountSelf-employed and freelancers who exclusively process their transactions online and who only make a few bookings per month benefit from the very attractive and understandable cost structure. The account is well suited for freelancers who primarily need the basic services for a business account. Thanks to the SMS service, customers remain informed about their account balance and movements around the clock, without having to log into online banking. This allows a very pleasant handling of the account and is especially advantageous when you are on business trips. The all-round service in combination with the low fees ensures that the account is a good basis for your business expenses."

    "content"     : "Penta is a young Berlin start-up that has started to change online banking for freelancers and small and medium-sized businesses. The start-up is not a bank in the classic sense, but a FinTech that is constantly coming onto the market with new services and is therefore particularly interesting for users who are open to innovations in banking and finance. Penta offers the business account in three variants. The Penta Advanced business account is considered the most popular model because it combines the most important services of a corporate account with a reasonable price.Penta Advanced Business Account ServicesThe account allows the processing of all cashless payment transactions at home and abroad through incoming and outgoing transfers. There is no contractual obligation. The basic price includes 100 SEPA transfers per month. A maximum of two users have access to the account, and the number of credit cards is also limited to two.For whom is the Penta Advanced business account suitable?In principle, this account is suitable for all young entrepreneurs. It is particularly suitable for freelancers or start-ups in which two partners are involved in the foundation. Both partners are granted access to online banking, both receive a Mastercard. The Penta Advanced is therefore suitable for companies with the legal form UG or GmbH, if two partners are founding, but also for a partnership under civil law, for a general partnership or for a limited partnership. According to German company law, two shareholders must be involved in these legal forms. The Advanced Account is therefore not only recommended for beginners, but also for companies on a growth course.Prices &amp;amp; Conditions of the Penta Advanced Business AccountThe basic fee is nine Euro per month, a reduction of the costs for founders is not planned. This price includes 100 SEPA transfers per month, each additional transfer costs 0.20 euros. Two users of online banking and Mastercards are also covered in this price. For payments abroad there is a fee of six euros per payment, foreign currency fees amount to 1.50 percent of Penta’s turnover.Special features of the Penta Advanced business accountIn addition to payment transactions, the young start-up offers a range of other services. These include, for example  automated accounting,  Transactions in foreign currencies,  A payroll accounting,  Factoring and  an invoicing system.It is also noticeable that the Penta start-up company regularly launches new services that extend the range of services for the business account. Customers are given a say in the development of these services, so that new features can be implemented quickly if the majority of account holders express interest. As a result, it is to be expected that the range of services will be further expanded in the coming years. This makes the account particularly interesting for account holders who are open to new trends in the financial market and who want to use them for themselves and their company.Penta Advanced business account: Advantages and disadvantagesThe Penta Advanced is very suitable for young entrepreneurs who are starting up with a partner. The range of services is consistently tailored to this. The account management remains flexible enough, but also manageable and calculable, so that no disproportionately high costs should arise. At present the withdrawal of cash via bank card is not yet planned. Only Mastercard can be used to withdraw cash at ATMs. This can be impractical for users who need to obtain cash more frequently for their business. The lack of an overdraft facility is also a disadvantage.Open a business account with PentaThe opening of the Penta Advanced is fully digitalized. It takes about ten minutes to enter personal and company data. If there is a shareholders’ agreement for the company, this must be submitted. The account holder is identified via VideoIdent, which saves the journey to the post office.

With this account, Penta offers this target group interesting services at a reasonable and calculable price.Penta also offers a Basic and a Premium version."

Penta itself does not hold a banking licence, but provides the business account through a cooperation with solarisBank. The FinTech company has set itself the goal of bringing simple and clearly structured online banking with intuitive user guidance onto the market. Penta Basic is the account for beginners.Services of the Penta Basic business accountFor the Penta Basic, mobile banking is available via an app. It works under Android and iOS. A web application is also available. The account management is designed for one user. A Business Mastercard is linked to the account, enabling cash withdrawals worldwide.For whom is the Penta Basic business account suitable?FinTech from Berlin uses the Basic Account to address business customers who have their company headquarters or a place of residence in Germany. The account is suitable for all common legal forms, such as the GbR or the KG, but also for larger companies such as the AG. Also a GmbH or a UG in foundation can open the Penta Basic and pay the share capital immediately. The Penta Basic is particularly suitable for freelancers and small to medium-sized companies or start-ups. At the beginning, freelancers or very young companies still have few transactions on their accounts. 50 free bank transfers are sufficient for them, larger companies, on the other hand, are seldom enough.Prices &amp;amp; Conditions of the Penta Basic Business AccountThe account management and Business Mastercard of the Penta Basic are free of charge. A maximum of 50 transfers per month can be made free of charge. Each additional transfer costs 0.20 Euro. The withdrawal of cash with the Business Mastercard is subject to a fee, per transaction two percent of the turnover, the minimum fee is two euros. This makes the account well suited for cashless payment transactions.Special features of the Penta Basic business accountThe company account may be used as a dual account if a first business account is already maintained with another bank. This is useful in cases where the main account does not offer a service provided by Penta Basic. It is interesting that customers have a say in the introduction of new functions. The more customers support a new feature, the safer it will be to implement it soon.Advantages and disadvantages of the Penta Basic business accountThe biggest advantage is the clear and transparent price structure. With the free account management and Business Mastercard, all important functions for cashless payment transactions are covered. As it is a credit account, it can also be opened with a Schufa entry. The worldwide supply of cash is guaranteed for a fee. Customer support is offered in German and English.A negative aspect is that it is currently not possible to deposit cash. A disbursement credit is also not set up, therefore the Penta Basic acts as a credit account. Cash withdrawals are subject to a fee.Open Penta Basic Business AccountThe Penta Basic is easy to open online with just a few details. The start-up company does not offer any other options. The registration takes about 15 minutes and includes data about the account holder and his company as well as personal identification by VideoIdent. A passport or identity card is sufficient. If available, the articles of association and the list of shareholders must be presented. Penta activates the account within two banking days. The Mastercard can then be ordered.Conclusion to the Penta Basic business accountPenta Basic consistently dispenses with services that are not absolutely necessary for young companies. This makes it inexpensive and also recommended for freelancers and young start-ups. If you have several users for the account or need a larger scope of services, the two accounts Advanced and Premium from Penta could also be interesting for you."

Up to five users have access to the account, a maximum of five Mastercards may be applied for. The basic fee includes 300 SEPA transfers per month and an unlimited number of card payments. Withdrawals of cash by Mastercard are possible worldwide. A bank card is not provided, nor is a overdraft facility granted.For whom is the Penta Premium business account suitable?With the Premium Account Penta would like to address preferably young enterprises of all legal forms, which are already a little established. By issuing several Business Mastercards and providing access to the account for several users, Penta Premium is primarily of interest to companies with several shareholders.Prices &amp;amp; Conditions of the Penta Premium Business AccountFor the Penta Premium business account there is a fee of 19 Euro per month. The credit card is free of charge, for the withdrawal of cash worldwide costs of two percent of the turnover are charged. The minimum fee is two euros. Companies in formation can use the start-up tariff of nine euros.Special features of the Penta Premium business accountInteresting is the integration of further services that may be necessary for a young company in its start-up phase. These include, for example, the execution of transactions in a foreign currency, automated accounting and payroll accounting. Factoring can also be carried out. If desired, the Penta Premium can be used as a second business account. This is useful if a company has already opened a business account that does not offer certain services or offers them for a fee.Penta Premium business account: Advantages and disadvantagesThe clear and unambiguous price structure deserves special mention. The premium account is subject to a fee; the total price covers all costs for account management, for issuing Mastercards and for access by a maximum of five users. The only additional costs are for withdrawing cash with Mastercard. The account holder therefore knows exactly what charges he has to expect in each case. The account is managed on a credit basis, a credit line is not granted. Thus the Penta Premium comes very well into question for account owners, who may not open a business account with credit line due to an entry in the Schufa. The comprehensive customer support in German and English is also a positive feature.Negative is that no cash deposit is possible for the premium account and that no bank card is available. This is due to the fact that the company has no branch structure and does not cooperate with other banks when it comes to cash supply. As Penta is only a FinTech and does not hold a banking licence, it is not possible to set up a overdraft facility, although this may be necessary at the beginning of the business activity.Open Penta Premium Business AccountThe opening of the Premium business account takes about 20 minutes. The account holder must enter his personal data and details of his company. If a shareholder agreement or list of shareholders exists, this must be submitted. The identification takes place via VideoIdent and is done within a few minutes. After two to three bank working days the Penta Premium is opened, so that the Mastercards can be ordered.Conclusion: The Penta Premium Business AccountThe Penta Premium is well suited for young companies that are growing and are looking for an account that is inexpensive and easy to calculate. The cost structure is transparent and understandable, so that you know exactly what fees to expect each month. In addition, Penta consistently does without services that cost money and are not absolutely necessary for a start-up.Other Penta business accounts are Penta Basic and Penta Advanced."

Account statements are sent online, the Business Assistant with additional management tasks is included in the Tablet App. A Visa Card in the Classic or Gold version is also included. Paperless and paper-based bookings are carried out, whereby the cost structure shows that Postbank prefers paperless bookings. Cash can be collected at the counter or alternatively ATMs are available in banks of the cash group.Who is the Postbank Business Giro aktiv plus suitable for?The Postbank Giro aktiv plus is suitable for companies whose number of transactions per month justifies the basic fee. The costs for paperless transactions are very attractive, but the basic fee per month is higher than for other account models. There is a financial advantage for the company if there is a correspondingly high number of transactions per month. The account is therefore suitable for self-employed persons whose company is established or who expect a major upturn in the foreseeable future.Postbank Business Giro aktiv plus: Prices &amp;amp; conditionsThe basic fee for the account is 16.90 euros per month, regardless of the amount of the credit balance. The price includes account management, a Postbank Card, a disbursement credit with an interest rate of 7.99 percent per year, the release of online banking with mobile banking and telephone banking and the use of the Business Center for advisory services. Online dispatch of the account statement is also covered. The Visa credit card in the Classic version does not cost a basic fee in the first year, from the second year onwards the fee is 30 euros.

For this clientele, the high basic fee is worthwhile; it is offset by the favorable price for paperless bookings. A further advantage in addition to this attractive fee structure is the combination of online and advisory services, which are often indispensable for business customers.The disadvantage is the high basic fee, which makes the account rather uninteresting for companies that are still growing and that do not achieve a significant number of bookings per month.Open a business account with PostbankIt is possible to open an account online, a visit to the branch is not necessary. For opening an account, only a few data on the account holder and the company are required. The transfer takes place securely and is therefore risk-free for the account holder. Before the account can be used, it must be identified in a post office branch via PostIdent.Conclusion on Postbank Business Giro aktiv plus business accountThe Postbank Giro aktiv plus business account may appeal to established companies that regularly generate a certain turnover and carry out a corresponding number of transactions per month. For these companies, the combination of an online business account with a fairly high basic fee and personal advice is recommended. Those who can do without the extensive services of the Postbank Giro aktiv plus business accounts may be interested in the other two Postbank business accounts: the Postbank Business Giro aktiv or the simple Business Giro business account."
