The premium product “Metal” offers the complete service package with selected partner offers, but is even more expensive. In this respect, the N26 product range covers the individual needs of business customers with a wide variety of requirements.Services of the N26 Business You business accountThe basic services of N26’s business account include the withdrawal of cash in euro and payment in all currencies. Cash withdrawals are also possible worldwide in any currency. A black Mastercard is linked to the You account.

    "content"     : "N26 is one of the young providers of banking services. The company was not founded until 2013. The aim was to offer mobile banking at a reasonable price. The aim was to address either private or business customers. The preferred target group today is the self-employed who want a free checking account with the most important basic services.Services of the N26 Business Business AccountThe Business Business Account of N26 covers the most important services for freelancers. Withdrawing cash from ATMs in euros is free of charge, as is paying in any currency. There is an attractive cashback system for purchases, provided they have been paid for via the account. Private and business payment transactions can be processed jointly via the account. To use the free Business Mastercard, all transactions are sent in real time as a push message to the mobile phone. In this way, card payments, transfers and direct debits are displayed and automatically divided into categories.For whom is the N26 Business Business Account suitable?The N26 Business Account is suitable for self-employed and freelancers who want to use their account primarily for business purposes. If you want to open an account with N26, you are not yet allowed to be a customer of the provider. This means that the parallel use of a private and a business account is not possible. In addition, the main residence is limited to one of the countries where N26 is currently on the market. These include, among others, Germany and Austria.Prices &amp;amp; Conditions of the N26 Business Business AccountN26’s business account is free. Account maintenance fees are not charged.

The company name is therefore not visible on the account or on the card. To open an account, all you need is a PC or smartphone and no paper is required.Conclusion on the N26 Business business accountThis business account is ideal for freelancers who focus on the basic services of a current account and want to pay little for them. It is recommended that all private payment transactions be made through a separate account with another bank and not mixed."

So that customers always keep the overview of account balance and turnovers, they can book the SMS service for 1.50 € per month. This service notifies account holders of all transactions around the clock.Advantages and disadvantages of the netbank business accountAdvantages of the netbank business account are both the favourable account maintenance fee and the 10 free booking items per month. The fee structure is very easy to understand and transparent. Those who are satisfied with a digital account statement also do not have to pay anything for it. If desired, financial software can be integrated as long as it is compatible with HBCI and FinTS. Even more transparency and a comprehensive overview are provided to customers thanks to the SMS service, which provides full information on all expenses and transactions and is available for a small fee of 1.50 per month. Since netbank is a direct bank, it is not possible to visit a branch, which can be a disadvantage for some users. If you want to withdraw money frequently with MasterCard, you will quickly incur high costs, as withdrawals are only possible once a month free of charge. It is therefore advisable to use another credit card to withdraw cash. There are deductions for the fact that netbank does not offer the account for every legal form, but only grants access to freelancers, sole traders and sole entrepreneurs. No overdraft facility is granted for the account; overdraft interest of 13% is charged. It thus corresponds to a credit account. Payments or transfers can only be made if there is a credit balance on the account. If this is the case, however, the fees for transactions are favourable.Open a business account with netbankThe account is opened online. If an account is opened, a preliminary check is carried out on the basis of the information you have provided. This also includes the Schufa check, which enables the account to be opened in an uncomplicated and timely manner. The first prerequisite for opening an account is therefore to provide personal and business data. The PostIdent procedure is required for legitimisation. If the account is then activated, it can be used directly.Conclusion on the netbank business accountSelf-employed and freelancers who exclusively process their transactions online and who only make a few bookings per month benefit from the very attractive and understandable cost structure. The account is well suited for freelancers who primarily need the basic services for a business account. Thanks to the SMS service, customers remain informed about their account balance and movements around the clock, without having to log into online banking. This allows a very pleasant handling of the account and is especially advantageous when you are on business trips. The all-round service in combination with the low fees ensures that the account is a good basis for your business expenses."

    "content"     : "Penta is a young Berlin start-up that has started to change online banking for freelancers and small and medium-sized businesses. The start-up is not a bank in the classic sense, but a FinTech that is constantly coming onto the market with new services and is therefore particularly interesting for users who are open to innovations in banking and finance. Penta offers the business account in three variants. The Penta Advanced business account is considered the most popular model because it combines the most important services of a corporate account with a reasonable price.Penta Advanced Business Account ServicesThe account allows the processing of all cashless payment transactions at home and abroad through incoming and outgoing transfers. There is no contractual obligation. The basic price includes 100 SEPA transfers per month. A maximum of two users have access to the account, and the number of credit cards is also limited to two.For whom is the Penta Advanced business account suitable?In principle, this account is suitable for all young entrepreneurs. It is particularly suitable for freelancers or start-ups in which two partners are involved in the foundation. Both partners are granted access to online banking, both receive a Mastercard. The Penta Advanced is therefore suitable for companies with the legal form UG or GmbH, if two partners are founding, but also for a partnership under civil law, for a general partnership or for a limited partnership. According to German company law, two shareholders must be involved in these legal forms. The Advanced Account is therefore not only recommended for beginners, but also for companies on a growth course.Prices &amp;amp; Conditions of the Penta Advanced Business AccountThe basic fee is nine Euro per month, a reduction of the costs for founders is not planned. This price includes 100 SEPA transfers per month, each additional transfer costs 0.20 euros. Two users of online banking and Mastercards are also covered in this price. For payments abroad there is a fee of six euros per payment, foreign currency fees amount to 1.50 percent of Penta’s turnover.Special features of the Penta Advanced business accountIn addition to payment transactions, the young start-up offers a range of other services. These include, for example  automated accounting,  Transactions in foreign currencies,  A payroll accounting,  Factoring and  an invoicing system.It is also noticeable that the Penta start-up company regularly launches new services that extend the range of services for the business account. Customers are given a say in the development of these services, so that new features can be implemented quickly if the majority of account holders express interest. As a result, it is to be expected that the range of services will be further expanded in the coming years. This makes the account particularly interesting for account holders who are open to new trends in the financial market and who want to use them for themselves and their company.Penta Advanced business account: Advantages and disadvantagesThe Penta Advanced is very suitable for young entrepreneurs who are starting up with a partner. The range of services is consistently tailored to this. The account management remains flexible enough, but also manageable and calculable, so that no disproportionately high costs should arise. At present the withdrawal of cash via bank card is not yet planned. Only Mastercard can be used to withdraw cash at ATMs. This can be impractical for users who need to obtain cash more frequently for their business. The lack of an overdraft facility is also a disadvantage.Open a business account with PentaThe opening of the Penta Advanced is fully digitalized. It takes about ten minutes to enter personal and company data. If there is a shareholders’ agreement for the company, this must be submitted. The account holder is identified via VideoIdent, which saves the journey to the post office. Two to three days after the identification has been carried out, the account is activated for use.Conclusion on the Penta Advanced business accountThe Penta Advanced may appeal to young entrepreneurs who are starting up with a partner and who are already on a growth course. With this account, Penta offers this target group interesting services at a reasonable and calculable price.Penta also offers a Basic and a Premium version."

    "content"     : "One provider of business accounts is Penta, a young start-up based in Berlin. Penta itself does not hold a banking licence, but provides the business account through a cooperation with solarisBank. The FinTech company has set itself the goal of bringing simple and clearly structured online banking with intuitive user guidance onto the market. Penta Basic is the account for beginners.Services of the Penta Basic business accountFor the Penta Basic, mobile banking is available via an app. It works under Android and iOS. A web application is also available. The account management is designed for one user. A Business Mastercard is linked to the account, enabling cash withdrawals worldwide.For whom is the Penta Basic business account suitable?FinTech from Berlin uses the Basic Account to address business customers who have their company headquarters or a place of residence in Germany. The account is suitable for all common legal forms, such as the GbR or the KG, but also for larger companies such as the AG. Also a GmbH or a UG in foundation can open the Penta Basic and pay the share capital immediately. The Penta Basic is particularly suitable for freelancers and small to medium-sized companies or start-ups. At the beginning, freelancers or very young companies still have few transactions on their accounts. 50 free bank transfers are sufficient for them, larger companies, on the other hand, are seldom enough.Prices &amp;amp; Conditions of the Penta Basic Business AccountThe account management and Business Mastercard of the Penta Basic are free of charge. A maximum of 50 transfers per month can be made free of charge. Each additional transfer costs 0.20 Euro. The withdrawal of cash with the Business Mastercard is subject to a fee, per transaction two percent of the turnover, the minimum fee is two euros. This makes the account well suited for cashless payment transactions.Special features of the Penta Basic business accountThe company account may be used as a dual account if a first business account is already maintained with another bank. This is useful in cases where the main account does not offer a service provided by Penta Basic. It is interesting that customers have a say in the introduction of new functions. The more customers support a new feature, the safer it will be to implement it soon.Advantages and disadvantages of the Penta Basic business accountThe biggest advantage is the clear and transparent price structure. With the free account management and Business Mastercard, all important functions for cashless payment transactions are covered. As it is a credit account, it can also be opened with a Schufa entry. The worldwide supply of cash is guaranteed for a fee. Customer support is offered in German and English.A negative aspect is that it is currently not possible to deposit cash. A disbursement credit is also not set up, therefore the Penta Basic acts as a credit account. Cash withdrawals are subject to a fee.Open Penta Basic Business AccountThe Penta Basic is easy to open online with just a few details. The start-up company does not offer any other options. The registration takes about 15 minutes and includes data about the account holder and his company as well as personal identification by VideoIdent. A passport or identity card is sufficient. If available, the articles of association and the list of shareholders must be presented. Penta activates the account within two banking days. The Mastercard can then be ordered.Conclusion to the Penta Basic business accountPenta Basic consistently dispenses with services that are not absolutely necessary for young companies. This makes it inexpensive and also recommended for freelancers and young start-ups. If you have several users for the account or need a larger scope of services, the two accounts Advanced and Premium from Penta could also be interesting for you."

    "content"     : "Penta Premium is a business account for young companies of all legal forms. Penta is not a commercial bank in the classical sense, but a start-up from the FinTech sector. The young company has its headquarters in Berlin. The declared goal is to offer small and medium-sized companies a business account in several variants that are reduced to the essential services.Services of the Penta Premium business accountThe account ensures the processing of cashless payment transactions by means of bank transfers. Up to five users have access to the account, a maximum of five Mastercards may be applied for. The basic fee includes 300 SEPA transfers per month and an unlimited number of card payments. Withdrawals of cash by Mastercard are possible worldwide. A bank card is not provided, nor is a overdraft facility granted.For whom is the Penta Premium business account suitable?With the Premium Account Penta would like to address preferably young enterprises of all legal forms, which are already a little established. By issuing several Business Mastercards and providing access to the account for several users, Penta Premium is primarily of interest to companies with several shareholders.Prices &amp;amp; Conditions of the Penta Premium Business AccountFor the Penta Premium business account there is a fee of 19 Euro per month. The credit card is free of charge, for the withdrawal of cash worldwide costs of two percent of the turnover are charged. The minimum fee is two euros. Companies in formation can use the start-up tariff of nine euros.Special features of the Penta Premium business accountInteresting is the integration of further services that may be necessary for a young company in its start-up phase. These include, for example, the execution of transactions in a foreign currency, automated accounting and payroll accounting. Factoring can also be carried out. If desired, the Penta Premium can be used as a second business account. This is useful if a company has already opened a business account that does not offer certain services or offers them for a fee.Penta Premium business account: Advantages and disadvantagesThe clear and unambiguous price structure deserves special mention. The premium account is subject to a fee; the total price covers all costs for account management, for issuing Mastercards and for access by a maximum of five users. The only additional costs are for withdrawing cash with Mastercard. The account holder therefore knows exactly what charges he has to expect in each case. The account is managed on a credit basis, a credit line is not granted. Thus the Penta Premium comes very well into question for account owners, who may not open a business account with credit line due to an entry in the Schufa. The comprehensive customer support in German and English is also a positive feature.Negative is that no cash deposit is possible for the premium account and that no bank card is available. This is due to the fact that the company has no branch structure and does not cooperate with other banks when it comes to cash supply. As Penta is only a FinTech and does not hold a banking licence, it is not possible to set up a overdraft facility, although this may be necessary at the beginning of the business activity.Open Penta Premium Business AccountThe opening of the Premium business account takes about 20 minutes. The account holder must enter his personal data and details of his company. If a shareholder agreement or list of shareholders exists, this must be submitted. The identification takes place via VideoIdent and is done within a few minutes. After two to three bank working days the Penta Premium is opened, so that the Mastercards can be ordered.Conclusion: The Penta Premium Business AccountThe Penta Premium is well suited for young companies that are growing and are looking for an account that is inexpensive and easy to calculate. The cost structure is transparent and understandable, so that you know exactly what fees to expect each month. In addition, Penta consistently does without services that cost money and are not absolutely necessary for a start-up.Other Penta business accounts are Penta Basic and Penta Advanced."

It offers each customer group a tailored package of services, combining digital services with personal advice. Around 300,000 companies in Germany rely on this service. Postbank has designed a business account for them in three variants to cover their individual needs. Postbank Giro aktiv plus is suitable for companies that already record a large number of transactions month after month.Postbank business account servicesThe Postbank Giro aktiv plus is subject to a flat monthly fee. The price includes a Postbank Card. A overdraft facility can be granted for the account. Online banking, telephone banking and mobile banking are included. Account statements are sent online, the Business Assistant with additional management tasks is included in the Tablet App. A Visa Card in the Classic or Gold version is also included. Paperless and paper-based bookings are carried out, whereby the cost structure shows that Postbank prefers paperless bookings. Cash can be collected at the counter or alternatively ATMs are available in banks of the cash group.Who is the Postbank Business Giro aktiv plus suitable for?The Postbank Giro aktiv plus is suitable for companies whose number of transactions per month justifies the basic fee. The costs for paperless transactions are very attractive, but the basic fee per month is higher than for other account models. There is a financial advantage for the company if there is a correspondingly high number of transactions per month. The account is therefore suitable for self-employed persons whose company is established or who expect a major upturn in the foreseeable future.Postbank Business Giro aktiv plus: Prices &amp;amp; conditionsThe basic fee for the account is 16.90 euros per month, regardless of the amount of the credit balance. The price includes account management, a Postbank Card, a disbursement credit with an interest rate of 7.99 percent per year, the release of online banking with mobile banking and telephone banking and the use of the Business Center for advisory services.

A Postbank debit card is included in the price, another card costs 0.50 euros per month.Advantages and disadvantages of the Postbank business accountThe Postbank Giro aktiv plus business account was developed for customers who carry out a large number of transactions per month. For this clientele, the high basic fee is worthwhile; it is offset by the favorable price for paperless bookings. A further advantage in addition to this attractive fee structure is the combination of online and advisory services, which are often indispensable for business customers.The disadvantage is the high basic fee, which makes the account rather uninteresting for companies that are still growing and that do not achieve a significant number of bookings per month.Open a business account with PostbankIt is possible to open an account online, a visit to the branch is not necessary. For opening an account, only a few data on the account holder and the company are required. The transfer takes place securely and is therefore risk-free for the account holder. Before the account can be used, it must be identified in a post office branch via PostIdent.Conclusion on Postbank Business Giro aktiv plus business accountThe Postbank Giro aktiv plus business account may appeal to established companies that regularly generate a certain turnover and carry out a corresponding number of transactions per month. For these companies, the combination of an online business account with a fairly high basic fee and personal advice is recommended. Those who can do without the extensive services of the Postbank Giro aktiv plus business accounts may be interested in the other two Postbank business accounts: the Postbank Business Giro aktiv or the simple Business Giro business account."

This service is important for companies in growth, but also for established medium-sized companies. The fee structure is relatively complex. In addition, the fees are charged every month and are a significant factor in the long term. If a company has already reached a certain size and achieves regular sales, these costs will not be particularly significant. The situation is different for young companies that are not yet established and do not yet have regular incoming payments. The Business Giro is actively less suitable for these companies.Actively opening Postbank Business GiroThe Business Giro aktiv is opened online on Postbank’s website. The data is transferred via a secure connection. Only a small amount of information is required for the opening. The process is easy to understand and intuitive.
