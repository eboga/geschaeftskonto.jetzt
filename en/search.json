    "content"     : "Postbank is a point of contact for private customers, business customers and corporate customers in all financial matters. It offers each customer group a tailored package of services, combining digital services with personal advice. Around 300,000 companies in Germany rely on this service. Postbank has designed a business account for them in three variants to cover their individual needs. Postbank Giro aktiv plus is suitable for companies that already record a large number of transactions month after month.Postbank business account servicesThe Postbank Giro aktiv plus is subject to a flat monthly fee. The price includes a Postbank Card. A overdraft facility can be granted for the account. Online banking, telephone banking and mobile banking are included. Account statements are sent online, the Business Assistant with additional management tasks is included in the Tablet App. A Visa Card in the Classic or Gold version is also included. Paperless and paper-based bookings are carried out, whereby the cost structure shows that Postbank prefers paperless bookings. Cash can be collected at the counter or alternatively ATMs are available in banks of the cash group.Who is the Postbank Business Giro aktiv plus suitable for?The Postbank Giro aktiv plus is suitable for companies whose number of transactions per month justifies the basic fee. The costs for paperless transactions are very attractive, but the basic fee per month is higher than for other account models. There is a financial advantage for the company if there is a correspondingly high number of transactions per month. The account is therefore suitable for self-employed persons whose company is established or who expect a major upturn in the foreseeable future.Postbank Business Giro aktiv plus: Prices &amp;amp; conditionsThe basic fee for the account is 16.90 euros per month, regardless of the amount of the credit balance. The price includes account management, a Postbank Card, a disbursement credit with an interest rate of 7.99 percent per year, the release of online banking with mobile banking and telephone banking and the use of the Business Center for advisory services. Online dispatch of the account statement is also covered. The Visa credit card in the Classic version does not cost a basic fee in the first year, from the second year onwards the fee is 30 euros. The fee for voucherless bookings is set at 0.08 euros per transaction, for voucherless bookings the cost is 1.50 euros. The withdrawal of cash is free of charge in the branch and at the ATM. A Postbank debit card is included in the price, another card costs 0.50 euros per month.Advantages and disadvantages of the Postbank business accountThe Postbank Giro aktiv plus business account was developed for customers who carry out a large number of transactions per month. For this clientele, the high basic fee is worthwhile; it is offset by the favorable price for paperless bookings. A further advantage in addition to this attractive fee structure is the combination of online and advisory services, which are often indispensable for business customers.The disadvantage is the high basic fee, which makes the account rather uninteresting for companies that are still growing and that do not achieve a significant number of bookings per month.Open a business account with PostbankIt is possible to open an account online, a visit to the branch is not necessary. For opening an account, only a few data on the account holder and the company are required. The transfer takes place securely and is therefore risk-free for the account holder. Before the account can be used, it must be identified in a post office branch via PostIdent.Conclusion on Postbank Business Giro aktiv plus business accountThe Postbank Giro aktiv plus business account may appeal to established companies that regularly generate a certain turnover and carry out a corresponding number of transactions per month. For these companies, the combination of an online business account with a fairly high basic fee and personal advice is recommended. Those who can do without the extensive services of the Postbank Giro aktiv plus business accounts may be interested in the other two Postbank business accounts: the Postbank Business Giro aktiv or the simple Business Giro business account."
